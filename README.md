## Key build operations

This project uses Maven as its build system. Unless stated otherwise, instructions below assume that Maven commands
will be executed from the directory of the parent module.

To run:

**Unit tests**:

```
mvn test
```

**Standalone Hippo instance**:

```
mvn verify

production code. The first line runs unit tests and packages the application and the second one starts it.
