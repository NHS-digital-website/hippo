# NHS Digital Publication System - Hippo CMS

[![Build Status][build-status]][travis-project-page]

To quickly setup this project run `make init`. To get more help, simply run
`make help`.




## Key build operations

This project uses Maven as its build system. Unless stated otherwise, instructions below assume that Maven commands
will be executed from the directory of the parent module.

To run:

**Unit tests**:

```
mvn test
```

**Full suite of tests**:

```
mvn verify -Pacceptance-test
```

This will execute run both unit and acceptance tests. An instance of Tomcat server will be automatically spawned and
applications under test deployed into it prior to executing automated acceptance tests. The server will automatically
stop once the tests complete. Tomcat server gets automatically downloaded and installed in a temporary project space as
part of the build so it doesn't have to already be present in the development system.

Note that by default the acceptance tests will be executed in a 'headless' mode, that is no browser window will be
opened on the screen. To in order to see the web browser during automated accepance tests, disable headless mode by
adding parameter `-Dheadless=false` in the command line.

**Standalone Hippo instance**:

```
mvn verify
mvn -Pcargo.run
```

This will run Hippo in a standalone mode - useful during manual testing and development of the changes to the
production code. The first line runs unit tests and packages the application and the second one starts it.
