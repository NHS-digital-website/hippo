Feature: Dataset edit screen - validation

    As an administrator I need to ensure that the CMS rejects invalid values in the dataset edit screen
    so that there is less risk of invalid data being stored in the repository


    @DiscardAfter
    Scenario: Title validation
        Given I have a dataset opened for editing
        And I populate the dataset
        When I clear the title
        And I save the dataset
        Then the save is rejected with error message containing "A mandatory string input field is empty"

        Then the save is rejected with error message containing "A mandatory string input field is empty"


    @DiscardAfter
    Scenario: Nominal date validation
        Given I have a dataset opened for editing

        Then the save is rejected with error message containing "Title must be 250 characters or less"


    @DiscardAfter
    Scenario: Forbidden file type upload rejection
        Given I have a dataset opened for editing

            | BAT |
            | COM |
            | CMD |
