Feature: Faceted Time Frame search

    As a content consumer I need to be able to filter search results so I can easily
    navigate to the documents I'm interested in.

    # Note these are in the CMS folder because they need to create publications with
    # a date relative to today and they do so via the CMS.

    @DeleteAfter
    Scenario: Relative date - today
        Given I have a published publication with nominal date falling before 0 days from now
        When I navigate to the "home" page
        And I search for the publication
        Then I should see the "TIMEFRAME" list containing:
            | today (1)      |
            | this week (1)  |
            | this month (1) |
            | this year (1)  |


    @DeleteAfter
    Scenario: Relative date - yesterday
        Given I have a published publication with nominal date falling before -1 days from now
        When I navigate to the "home" page
        And I search for the publication
        # Just check it includes 'yesterday' as we don't know if yesterday is this week/month/year or not
        Then I should see the "TIMEFRAME" list including:
            | yesterday (1) |
        And I should see the "TIMEFRAME" list not including:
            | today ... |


    @DeleteAfter
    Scenario: Relative date - last year
        Given I have a published publication with nominal date falling before -1 years from now
        When I navigate to the "home" page
        And I search for the publication
        Then I should see the "TIMEFRAME" list containing:
            | before this year (1) |


    @DeleteAfter
    Scenario: Relative date - this week
        Given I have a published publication with nominal date falling this week
        When I navigate to the "home" page
        And I search for the publication
        # Don't know if it's this month or year but it's not today or yesterday
        Then I should see the "TIMEFRAME" list including:
            | this week (1) |
        And I should see the "TIMEFRAME" list not including:
            | today ...     |
            | yesterday ... |
