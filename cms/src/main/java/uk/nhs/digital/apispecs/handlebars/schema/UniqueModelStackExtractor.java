/**
 * <p>
 * Extracts models from given stack of {@linkplain Context} objects
 * preserving original order and ensuring that unique instances of models
 * are returned where such models were adjacent in the stack (see tests
 * for illustration).
 * <p>
 * In some cases the parent object contains the same model as the current
 * context; this appears to be a result of certain expressions in Handlebars'
 * templates that change 'context'
 * (e.g. <code>{{#each aProperty}...{{>nestedTemplate}}...{{each}}</code>) as is
 * the case with Schema Objects.
 * <p>
 * This incorrectly inflates the number of, say, indentation levels
 * and so this class makes sure that adjacent duplicates are eliminated from
 * the returned stack of model objects.
 * <p>
 * We rely on equality by reference rather than by value because some model objects
 * may be quite empty, thus risking {@linkplain Object#equals(Object)} returning
 * {@code true} when they are actually different instances. Also, it's enough to
 * just compare to the previous model as, in real life, the duplicate references
 * were only ever seen to be adjacent to each other in the stack.
