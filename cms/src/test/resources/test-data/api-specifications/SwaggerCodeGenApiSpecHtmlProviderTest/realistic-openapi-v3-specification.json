    "description": "## Overview\nUse this API to access the [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics) - the national electronic database of NHS patient details such as name, address, date of birth and NHS Number.\n\nYou can:\n* search for patients\n* get patient details\n* get patient related people\n\nYou cannot currently use this API to:\n* check that you have the right NHS Number for a patient\n* update patient details (coming soon)\n* create a new record for a birth\n* receive birth notifications\n* create a record for a new patient\n* register a new patient at a GP Practice - instead, use [National Health Application and Infrastructure Services (NHAIS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhais/nhais-developer-document-library)\n\nYou can access the following data:\n* NHS Number\n* name\n* gender\n* addresses and contact details\n* birth information\n* death information\n* registered GP\n* nominated pharmacy\n* dispensing doctor pharmacy\n* medical appliance supplier pharmacy\n* related people\n* consent information (coming soon)\n\nCurrently, this API can only be accessed by healthcare professionals, authenticated with an NHS smartcard or equivalent.\nUnauthenticated access and citizen access are on the roadmap.\n\n## Legal use\nThis API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. You should [make a PDS access request](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/access-data-on-the-personal-demographics-service) before you go too far with your development.\n\nYou must have made this request before you can go live (see \u2018Onboarding\u2019 below).\n\n## Related APIs\nThe following APIs also give access to the Personal Demographics Service:\n- [Personal Demographics Service (SMSP) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-specifications/personal-demographics-service---smsp-api) - use this if you want to get PDS data without an authenticated end used (no smartcard required). It is, however, read-only and searches are limited to a single result.\n- [Personal Demographics Service (HL7 V3) API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-specifications/personal-demographics-service-hl7-v3) - use this if you want to use functions that are not yet available on the FHIR API.\n\nOnce our roadmap is complete, the above APIs will become redundant.\n\nThe following APIs are also related to this API:\n- [Organisation Data Service FHIR API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/) - use this to get full details for the organisations related to the patient, such as their registered GP or nominated pharmacy.\n\n## API status and roadmap\nThe search and retrieve endpoints are in [beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:\n- we might make breaking changes, but only if we can't avoid it, and we'll give you advance notice\n- we can't guarantee availability or performance\n\nThe update endpoint is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/reference-guide#api-status), meaning\n- expect further breaking changes\n- it's only available in our sandbox, not for integration testing or production use\n\nThe following items are on our roadmap, in rough priority order:\n- addition of data fields for consent information\n- update patient - beta - integration testing (target date: end of June 2020)\n- update patient - beta - production service (target date to be confirmed)\n- unauthenticated access - without NHS smartcard - similar to the PDS SMSP API (target date to be confirmed - please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support) for more details)\n- access for citizens using NHS Login (target date to be confirmed - please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support) for more details)\n- exit beta (target date: end of September 2020, subject to availability of beta testers)\n\nWe are extremely keen to receive feedback on the API during beta,\nfor example if there are data fields missing that you think you need.\nPlease [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support) with any comments or suggestions.\n\n## Technology\nThis API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/introduction-to-apis#basic-rest).\n\nIt also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/introduction-to-apis#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.\nSpecifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.\nIn particular:\n- resource names are capitalised and singular, for example the `/Patient` not `/patients`\n- array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines\n- data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object\n\nThis API is available on the Internet, although access using NHS smartcards (see below)\ncurrently requires a connection to the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).\n\n## Authorisation\nThis API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),\nmeaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.\n\nThe end user must be:\n- a healthcare professional\n- strongly authenticated, using either an NHS smartcard or a modern alternative\n\nThe API uses Open ID Connect to authenticate the end user and OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling system.\nIt supports the following security patterns:\n* user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS Identity - combined authentication and authorisation\n* user-restricted RESTful API - using NHS Identity - separate authentication and authorisation\n\nFor more details, see [user-restricted APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis).\n\nIn due course we plan to add the following:\n- access for citizens, using NHS Login\n- unattended access - without smartcard - similar to the PDS SMSP API\n\n## Environments and testing\n\n| Environment       | Base URL                                                       |\n| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Sandbox           | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/personal-demographics/`    |\n| Integration test  | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/personal-demographics/`        |\n| Production        | Not yet available                                              |\n\n### Sandbox testing\nOur [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/testing#sandbox-testing):\n* is for early developer testing\n* only covers a limited set of scenarios\n* is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates\n* is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation\n\nFor more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our \"Try this API\" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.\n\nAlternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:\n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/dc052f444e70d072e577)\n\n### Integration testing\nOur [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/testing#integration-testing):\n* is for formal integration testing\n* includes authorisation, using either username/password (for early testing) or smartcard/PIN\n\nYou can use our [PDS FHIR API test data pack](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-specifications/pds-fhir-api-test-data) to test most common scenarios. You can also create your own test data.\n\nFor more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).\n\n## Onboarding\nYou need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it\u2019s worth planning well ahead.\n\nTo onboard for this API, follow the [Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL) process.](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/onboarding-process#onboard-using-the-supplier-conformance-assessment-list-scal-process)\n\nWhen following the SCAL process, note that:\n* In step 1: to confirm your use case for this API, you need to [make a PDS access request](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/access-data-on-the-personal-demographics-service), even if you already access PDS via another method.\n* In step 6: when implementing your clinical risk management process, you must review and integrate the PDS FHIR API clinical hazard log into your own risk log. You\u2019ll find it embedded within the PDS FHIR API tab in the SCAL.\n* In step 8: you need to review and complete the PDS FHIR API risk log to show that you have understood and mitigated the various risks. You might be asked to provide some evidence to prove that controls have been put in place. You\u2019ll find the risk log embedded within the PDS FHIR API tab in the SCAL. This is separate from the clinical hazard log mentioned above.\n* In step 9: you must conduct penetration testing to [CHECK standards](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/check-penetration-testing)\n* In step 10: when you complete the Service Desk Registration Form, send it to [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).\n* In step 11: submit your completed SCAL to [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).\n* In step 14: to request production access, contact us at [api.management@nhs.net](mailto:api.management@nhs.net).\n\n## Endpoints\nTo see details for specific endpoints, select from the list on the left hand side of the page:\n* `GET /Patient` - search for patients.\n* `GET /Patient/{id}` - get patient's personal details.\n* `GET /Patient/{id}/RelatedPerson` - get patient's related people details.\n* `PATCH /Patient/{id}` - update patient's personal details (coming soon).\n",

        "description": "## Overview\nUse this endpoint to search for a patient in PDS.\n\nYou can search using a combination of:\n  * given name\n  * family name\n  * gender\n  * postcode\n  * date of birth (range)\n  * date of death (range)\n  * registered GP practice\n\nEnsure that the search parameters are url encoded, especially when containing special characters. For example a `space` must be represented by either `%20` or `+`.\n\n## Matching rules\nSearch parameters are not case sensitive.\n\nSpaces in postcodes do not need to match exactly, for example `LS116AD` will match `LS11 6AD`, however including spaces will also work.\n\nFor date of birth and date of death, you can search for an exact date or for a range of dates.\n\nYou can use wildcards in given name and family name. Wildcards must start with at least two characters; for example, `Br*` is valid, but `*cDougal` is not. Multiple wildcards are allowed; for example, `Br*w*` will match `Brown` and `Brower`.\nBe sure that any wildcards are encoded before sending the request. An encoded wildcard is `%2A`; for example, `Br%2A` is valid.\n\nYou can request a fuzzy search using the `_fuzzy-match` query parameter. This will:\n  * match common homophones, such as `Smith` and `Smythe`, using the [Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) algorithm\n  * check for transposed names, such as `Adam Thomas` and `Thomas Adam`\n\nWildcards cannot be used with a fuzzy search.\n\n## Search parameter options\nFor a non-fuzzy search, the minimum set of search parameters is:\n* family name - but it can include wildcards\n* gender\n* date of birth - but it can be a range\n\nFor a fuzzy search, use one of the following search parameter combinations:\n* given name, family name and date of birth\n* family name, date of birth, gender and postcode\n* given name, date of birth, gender and postcode\n\nIf you include the date of death or registered GP Practice query parameters for a fuzzy search, they will not be used as part of the search. However they will affect the patient's matching score, meaning a mismatch will reduce the returned score.\n\nIf you use an invalid combination of query parameters, you will get an `INVALID_COMBINATION` error.\n\n## Historic data search\nBy default the endpoint only searches current information.\nYou can search historic information, such as previous names or addresses using the `_history` query parameter.\n\nYou cannot perform a fuzzy search on historic information.\n\n## Scoring\nEvery matched patient in the result list includes a score to indicate how closely the patient matched the search parameters.\n\nA score of 1.0 indicates an exact match. A score of less than 1.0 indicates a partial match.\n\nThe result list is sorted in descending score order - best match first.\n\nUse the `_exact-match` query parameter to return exact matches only - where the score is 1.0.\n\n## Restricted patients\nSome patients are tagged as restricted, or sensitive. When performing a search, restricted patients can be returned; however, location sensitive fields such as `address`, `telecom` and `generalPractitioner` will be removed.\n\nIf `address-postcode` or `general-practitioner` are included in the search parameters, no restricted patients will be returned even if a match is identified.\n\nThe restricted flag can be found in the data under `meta/security` on the patient resource.\n\nNHS Digital guidance on restricting access to a patient's details can be found [here](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/restricting-access-to-a-patients-demographic-record)\n\n## Number of results returned\nBy default, the endpoint will return a maximum of 50 results.\n\nIf there are more than 50 matching patients, the endpoint will return no results and the error response `TOO_MANY_MATCHES`.\nYou can further limit the number of results using the `_max-results` query parameter.\nYou can request a single, exact match using `_exact-match=true` and `_max-results=1`.\n\n## Clinical safety and privacy\nThis endpoint can return multiple matching patients for a given search, including partial matches.\n\nYou should ensure that you design, build and test your software to minimise these risks:\n* an end user selects the wrong patient from the results presented, so there is a risk of clinical harm; for example due to retrieval of the wrong medical data\n* the end user has access to patients\u2019 personal data, so there is a risk to patient privacy\n\nIn particular, it is almost certainly a good idea to display search results in descending score order - best match first.\n\n## Sandbox testing\nYou can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:\n\n| Scenario                    | Request                                                      | Response                                   |\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |\n| Basic search                | `family`=`Smith`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |\n| Wildcard search             | `family`=`Sm*`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22` | HTTP Status 200 with search result of two. |\n| Search with limited results | `family`=`Sm*`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22`, `_max-results`=`2` | HTTP Status 200 with search result of two. |\n| Search with date range      | `family`=`Smith`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`ge2010-10-21`, `birthdate`=`le2010-10-23` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |\n| Fuzzy search                | `family`=`Smith`, `given`=`Jane` `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2010-10-22`, `_fuzzy-match`=`true` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |\n| Sensitive patient search    | `family`=`Smythe`, `given`=`Janet` `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`eq2005-06-16` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result without restricted data. |\n| Unsuccessful search         | Any other valid search query parameters                      | HTTP Status 200 with no search results     |\n| Invalid date format         | `birthdate` or `death-date` query parameters with values not in format `YYYY-MM-DD` | HTTP Status 400 with problem description   |\n| Too few search parameters   | Any invalid combination of query parameters                  | HTTP Status 400 with problem description   |\n\nYou can try out the sandbox using the \"Try this API\" feature on the right hand side of this page.\n\nAlternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:\n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/dc052f444e70d072e577)\n",
