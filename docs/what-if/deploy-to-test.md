# What If I want to deploy to Test?

## How to Deploy a specific branch to a Test Environment

1. Stage and commit your changes to a branch. Push the branch to GitHub.

2. Open the team's Slack channel `#deployment-test`, `#deployment-dev` or
`#deployment-training` respectively.

3. Ask if test environment is free.

4. Within the respective channel type `/deploy DW-000-the-name-of-the-branch-to-deploy`

5. Wait for a notification on the same channel informing you of the
deployment's progress. The progress can also be [observed on GitHub](https://github.com/NHS-digital-website/hippo/actions).
