      hipposys:description: " This script constitutes the 'importer' component of\
        \ the Migrator application and should ONLY be used to import JSON files generated\
        \ by the latter:\n- with each file containing definition of only one document\
        \ or folder,\n- with files being named in the way where when ordered ascendingly\
        \ by their names, files defining folders will be processed before those defining\
        \ their content.\n\nKeep batch size set to 1 to ensure that folder files are\
        \ correctly processed; the system appears to only commit changes between individual\
        \ batches and if parent and child folders are created in the same batch, the\
        \ parent cannot be found when the child is being created. Keeping batch size\
        \ set to 1 ensures that changes from each import file are committed before\
        \ the next file is processed.\n\nNOTE that the expectation is that the script\
        \ will only ever be executed once as it has no logic to deal with partial\
        \ imports - if, say, a failure occurs and the script is re-run, duplicates\
        \ or further errors can be expected. "
