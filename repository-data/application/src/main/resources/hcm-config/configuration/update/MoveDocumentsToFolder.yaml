      hipposys:description: "Moves documents identified by the 'query' config settings\
        \ to a folder pointed to by 'targetFolderPath' parameter.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:\
        \ * Ensure that the query targets nodes of type 'hippo:handle' as, in its\
        \ current version the script, does not validate them (it's likely that it'll\
        \ equally well handle 'hippostd:folder' nodes but this hasn't been tesed).\
        \ * The script does not support a 'Dry run' as it relies on 'Workflow.move'\
        \ method to relocate documents and this results in a session being committed,\
        \ effectively invalidating the dry run. If you do want to do a dry run, comment\
        \ out the call to 'Workflow.move'. * The script does not implement 'undoUpdate'\
        \ method (note that clicking 'Undo' feeds the method with nodes identified\
        \ by the original query - in this case, the query will not find anything as\
        \ the nodes it returned previously will have already been moved by this script).\
        \ Having said that, it logs the new paths mapped to the original locations\
        \ (parent folders) of the moved documents to help identify what needs to be\
        \ moved back and where to."
