          <p>The Yaesu FT-ONE is an all-mode (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave" title="Continuous wave">CW</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-sideband_modulation" title="Single-sideband modulation">SSB</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation" title="Amplitude modulation">AM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying" title="Frequency-shift keying">FSK</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation" title="Frequency modulation">FM</a>) solid state general coverage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency" title="High frequency">HF</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio" title="Amateur radio">amateur radio</a> (HAM) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transceiver" title="Transceiver">transceiver</a>. The use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation" title="Frequency modulation">FM</a> required an optional FM board to be installed. The unit was designed for fixed, portable or mobile operation, although the size (380&nbsp;mm x 157&nbsp;mm x 350&nbsp;mm) and weight (17&nbsp;kg) made it more suitable for fixed use. The FT-ONE was built by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaesu_(brand)" title="Yaesu (brand)">Yaesu-Musen Corporation</a> (usually called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaesu_(brand)" title="Yaesu (brand)">Yaesu</a>) from 1982 to 1986. At its release, the FT-ONE was launched as the successor to the FT-902 and as the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaesu_(brand)" title="Yaesu (brand)">Yaesu</a> top-of-the-line transceiver. The FT-ONE was not only Yaesu’s first fully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_synthesizer" title="Frequency synthesizer">synthesized</a>, computer-controlled amateur band transceiver but it was also the first transceiver with a general coverage receiver. The FT-ONE was sold in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">U.S.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asian</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> markets. It was released in 1982 with a list price of $2800.00 US.</p>

            <p>I'm impressed on how well receive this rig.no cheap plastic, vy quiet receiver under my wire antennas...lw and inverted L for low bands and delta loop for highest. i have 1989 cpu inside the rig. here now i have a fault with no power output only on AM, but easily solved on ebay with a cheap second hand af unit. i'm cw only op. and so need to have digital frequency readout, rf gain, powerfull bf amplification, apf and a keyer....and so on as usual for only cw operators.i have others rig here ftdx3000d, ft 891 and vy young ft 301d...all i can say the ft one is second to none. if you find a gud shape ft one and you know the seller;-);-) do not esitate to buy this great receiver.<br />
            ps: i'm every day on hf with this radio....where the phase noise???? where the drift???<br />
            i have tons of quiet and stables hf qso...from more than 2 years to now!!!</p>

            <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p>

          <p>The Yaesu FT-ONE is an all-mode (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave" title="Continuous wave">CW</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-sideband_modulation" title="Single-sideband modulation">SSB</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation" title="Amplitude modulation">AM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying" title="Frequency-shift keying">FSK</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation" title="Frequency modulation">FM</a>) solid state general coverage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency" title="High frequency">HF</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio" title="Amateur radio">amateur radio</a> (HAM) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transceiver" title="Transceiver">transceiver</a>. The use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation" title="Frequency modulation">FM</a> required an optional FM board to be installed. The unit was designed for fixed, portable or mobile operation, although the size (380&nbsp;mm x 157&nbsp;mm x 350&nbsp;mm) and weight (17&nbsp;kg) made it more suitable for fixed use. The FT-ONE was built by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaesu_(brand)" title="Yaesu (brand)">Yaesu-Musen Corporation</a> (usually called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaesu_(brand)" title="Yaesu (brand)">Yaesu</a>) from 1982 to 1986. At its release, the FT-ONE was launched as the successor to the FT-902 and as the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaesu_(brand)" title="Yaesu (brand)">Yaesu</a> top-of-the-line transceiver. The FT-ONE was not only Yaesu’s first fully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_synthesizer" title="Frequency synthesizer">synthesized</a>, computer-controlled amateur band transceiver but it was also the first transceiver with a general coverage receiver. The FT-ONE was sold in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">U.S.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asian</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> markets. It was released in 1982 with a list price of $2800.00 US.</p>

            <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p>

                <p>First, a quick reminder of what 'content modularisation'&nbsp;is.</p>

                <p>Content modularisation is the name we’ve given to a project that will fundamentally change the way NHS website content is designed.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We’re looking to move away from designing web pages that can only be used in one way to designing content that can be used flexibly and that works for a range of platforms, channels and technologies - for example, mobile pages, apps, voice assistants and chatbots.</p>

                <p>This will mean that our content can be used by syndicators in smaller, more specific sections – or 'modules'.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>To find out more about what’s involved, see our <a href="https://developer.api.nhs.uk/about/modularisation">content modularisation: quick guide</a>.</p>

                <p>The biggest news from the team since my last update is that content modules are now available for 250 of the most popular medical condition topics on the NHS website.</p>

                <p>This has involved a lot of hard work from the team to ensure the content modules we provide are easy to use, meaningful, accessible, accurate and clinically safe.</p>

                <p>The 250 modularised topics are available for free to syndicators who sign up to our <a href="https://developer.api.nhs.uk/about/terms/latest">terms and conditions</a> through:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>our <a href="https://developer.api.nhs.uk/nhs-api">conditions API</a> – health content you can integrate into your service&nbsp;</li>

                <p>As awareness of our modularised content grows, and as more of it becomes available, it can be used by ever more diverse products and services. This can only be a benefit to the public, as they know that content from the NHS website can be trusted to give them information that is accurate and safe.</p>

                <p>For example, we’re currently working with a health charity interested in using our modularised content in an app they’re developing.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We’ve also been speaking to some organisations about using our modularised content in chatbots and voice channels.</p>

                <p>Our modularised content is still being developed and we welcome opportunities to collaborate with potential users.</p>

                <p>If you think you might benefit from modularised content in your product or service, get in touch at <a href="mailto:syndication.service@nhs.net.">syndication.service@nhs.net</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The team are currently working on modularising medicine pages from the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/">NHS website Medicines A to Z</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This includes creating content modules like:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>what a particular medicine is</li>
                 <li>how to take it</li>
                 <li>side effects</li>
                 <li>if you can take it while pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As part of this, we plan to add <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/terminology-and-classifications/snomed-ct">SNOMED codes</a> to our content. These codes will make it possible to link our content with clinical systems, so that clinicians can easily signpost patients to NHS information relevant to their specific medicine, condition, test or treatment.</p>

                <p>The team will also soon be looking at possible approaches to modularising advice for new parents in the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/">NHS Pregnancy and Baby guide</a>. The plan is for syndicators to be able to tie this content in more closely with digital child health records.<br />

                <p>First, a quick reminder of what 'content modularisation'&nbsp;is.</p>

                <p>Content modularisation is the name we’ve given to a project that will fundamentally change the way NHS website content is designed.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We’re looking to move away from designing web pages that can only be used in one way to designing content that can be used flexibly and that works for a range of platforms, channels and technologies - for example, mobile pages, apps, voice assistants and chatbots.</p>

                <p>This will mean that our content can be used by syndicators in smaller, more specific sections – or 'modules'.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The biggest news from the team since my last update is that content modules are now available for 250 of the most popular medical condition topics on the NHS website.</p>

                <p>This has involved a lot of hard work from the team to ensure the content modules we provide are easy to use, meaningful, accessible, accurate and clinically safe.</p>

                <p>The 250 modularised topics are available for free to syndicators who sign up to our <a href="https://developer.api.nhs.uk/about/terms/latest">terms and conditions</a> through:</p>

                <p>As awareness of our modularised content grows, and as more of it becomes available, it can be used by ever more diverse products and services. This can only be a benefit to the public, as they know that content from the NHS website can be trusted to give them information that is accurate and safe.</p>

                <p>For example, we’re currently working with a health charity interested in using our modularised content in an app they’re developing.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We’ve also been speaking to some organisations about using our modularised content in chatbots and voice channels.</p>

                <p>Our modularised content is still being developed and we welcome opportunities to collaborate with potential users.</p>

                <p>The team are currently working on modularising medicine pages from the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/">NHS website Medicines A to Z</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This includes creating content modules like:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>what a particular medicine is</li>
                 <li>how to take it</li>
                 <li>side effects</li>
                 <li>if you can take it while pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As part of this, we plan to add <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/terminology-and-classifications/snomed-ct">SNOMED codes</a> to our content. These codes will make it possible to link our content with clinical systems, so that clinicians can easily signpost patients to NHS information relevant to their specific medicine, condition, test or treatment.</p>

                <p>The team will also soon be looking at possible approaches to modularising advice for new parents in the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/">NHS Pregnancy and Baby guide</a>. The plan is for syndicators to be able to tie this content in more closely with digital child health records.<br />

                <p>As awareness of our modularised content grows, and as more of it becomes available, it can be used by ever more diverse products and services. This can only be a benefit to the public, as they know that content from the NHS website can be trusted to give them information that is accurate and safe.</p>

                <p>For example, we’re currently working with a health charity interested in using our modularised content in an app they’re developing.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We’ve also been speaking to some organisations about using our modularised content in chatbots and voice channels.</p>

                <p>Our modularised content is still being developed and we welcome opportunities to collaborate with potential users.</p>

                <p>The team are currently working on modularising medicine pages from the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/">NHS website Medicines A to Z</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This includes creating content modules like:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>what a particular medicine is</li>
                 <li>how to take it</li>
                 <li>side effects</li>
                 <li>if you can take it while pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As part of this, we plan to add <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/terminology-and-classifications/snomed-ct">SNOMED codes</a> to our content. These codes will make it possible to link our content with clinical systems, so that clinicians can easily signpost patients to NHS information relevant to their specific medicine, condition, test or treatment.</p>

                <p>The team will also soon be looking at possible approaches to modularising advice for new parents in the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/">NHS Pregnancy and Baby guide</a>. The plan is for syndicators to be able to tie this content in more closely with digital child health records.<br />

                <p><strong>The COVID-19 pandemic&nbsp;leaves me and my fellow midwives with a&nbsp;dilemma.&nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p>We need to support women through pregnancy. We need to examine them, take blood and&nbsp;organise&nbsp;scans&nbsp;–&nbsp;at the same&nbsp;time, we&nbsp;must&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;the number of times they come into hospital.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>So, how do we do that?&nbsp;The answer, in part, has been provided by technology.&nbsp;I am the digital midwife for the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust&nbsp;and the&nbsp;move to video consultations has been&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;positive.</p>

                <p>With the support of our Trust implementation team, we set up Attend Anywhere,&nbsp;a video call service for patients with pre-arranged appointments.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We were previously looking at video platforms with our Local Maternity Service, but the pandemic has certainly moved this along much more quickly. The software is&nbsp;secure&nbsp;and women can be assured that&nbsp;communications&nbsp;are confidential. The links are easily accessible from the trust’s website and people have their own identifier for logging on.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Being able to offer women a video call rather than a phone call has been important.&nbsp;Seeing our patients as well as hearing them makes a huge difference.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>These are worrying times. Women are anxious about their pregnancy, about catching COVID-19 and&nbsp;about the new reality of child birth during this situation. Their partner&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;always be with&nbsp;them in the hospital, for example.</p>

                <p>Being able to see you and put a face to a name helps our women feel more relaxed. We are better able to detect anxieties and reassure them.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We can have video calls with women on their own or they can include their partner.&nbsp;The partner can ask questions and be part of the conversation.&nbsp;We’ve had feedback from the partners who have said they have been grateful for that opportunity.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Another benefit of the system is being able to offer joint video consultations. Our mental health specialist midwife works with the Primary Health Care Team, who sit within a partner trust.&nbsp;Using Attend Anywhere meant we were able to bring the mental health nurse on board, so even though both the midwife and the mental health nurse were in different settings, they could still talk to the pregnant woman at the same time.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>It is satisfying to know that despite the difficult circumstances we find ourselves in, we are still offering a good service to our pregnant women.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Similarly, our breastfeeding midwives have had great success in supporting new mums at home with feeding issues. The video consultations are filling the gap as community teams have had to reduce post-natal home visits.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>One of our breastfeeding specialists, Emily, says the mothers have responded well to the video calls. The midwife can view the baby feeding and offer advice about latching on. Likewise, the mums have been able to watch our feeding demonstrations using dolls.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>As well as rolling out Attend Anywhere to ante-natal clinics, we are extending the service into the family liaison room. This room was specially set up for couples to meet up with a midwife to talk over events that may have been troubling or upsetting, such as an emergency caesarean or an unexpected intervention such as forceps delivery.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We can now offer a secure space through video to deliver this same service, which can help people better understand what has happened to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>There is no doubt that everyone is missing physical contact. Midwifery is a tactile profession &nbsp;but obviously we&nbsp;must&nbsp;be careful. When women come into hospital,&nbsp;we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;wear masks and gloves.</p>

                <p>It’s not normal and it is challenging, but the move to a video platform has been very positive and I’m sure we will continue to use it&nbsp;in the future.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>One-to-one appointments will continue to be important, but Lincolnshire is a very rural area and we have five peripheral clinics. Not everyone has a car and public transport is limited. If we can&nbsp;minimise&nbsp;that amount of travel, I think that will be of great benefit to our pregnant women.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The recent transition to an electronic maternity record&nbsp;is equally important, especially when appointments are held on the phone or over video calling. We’d be lost without them during this time. The maternity records also enable vital information to be shared with other hospitals and clinics. All our clinicians have access to our Maternity Information System wherever they are working from. That can only benefit a mum-to-be, who can give birth at any place, any time.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been very challenging but the technological adaptations we have had to make will be enduring in keeping us better connected.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>The COVID-19 pandemic&nbsp;leaves me and my fellow midwives with a&nbsp;dilemma.&nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p>We need to support women through pregnancy. We need to examine them, take blood and&nbsp;organise&nbsp;scans&nbsp;–&nbsp;at the same&nbsp;time, we&nbsp;must&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;the number of times they come into hospital.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>So, how do we do that?&nbsp;The answer, in part, has been provided by technology.&nbsp;I am the digital midwife for the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust&nbsp;and the&nbsp;move to video consultations has been&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;positive.</p>

                <p>With the support of our Trust implementation team, we set up Attend Anywhere,&nbsp;a video call service for patients with pre-arranged appointments.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We were previously looking at video platforms with our Local Maternity Service, but the pandemic has certainly moved this along much more quickly. The software is&nbsp;secure&nbsp;and women can be assured that&nbsp;communications&nbsp;are confidential. The links are easily accessible from the trust’s website and people have their own identifier for logging on.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Being able to offer women a video call rather than a phone call has been important.&nbsp;Seeing our patients as well as hearing them makes a huge difference.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>These are worrying times. Women are anxious about their pregnancy, about catching COVID-19 and&nbsp;about the new reality of child birth during this situation. Their partner&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;always be with&nbsp;them in the hospital, for example.</p>

                <p>Being able to see you and put a face to a name helps our women feel more relaxed. We are better able to detect anxieties and reassure them.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We can have video calls with women on their own or they can include their partner.&nbsp;The partner can ask questions and be part of the conversation.&nbsp;We’ve had feedback from the partners who have said they have been grateful for that opportunity.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Another benefit of the system is being able to offer joint video consultations. Our mental health specialist midwife works with the Primary Health Care Team, who sit within a partner trust.&nbsp;Using Attend Anywhere meant we were able to bring the mental health nurse on board, so even though both the midwife and the mental health nurse were in different settings, they could still talk to the pregnant woman at the same time.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>It is satisfying to know that despite the difficult circumstances we find ourselves in, we are still offering a good service to our pregnant women.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Similarly, our breastfeeding midwives have had great success in supporting new mums at home with feeding issues. The video consultations are filling the gap as community teams have had to reduce post-natal home visits.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>One of our breastfeeding specialists, Emily, says the mothers have responded well to the video calls. The midwife can view the baby feeding and offer advice about latching on. Likewise, the mums have been able to watch our feeding demonstrations using dolls.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>As well as rolling out Attend Anywhere to ante-natal clinics, we are extending the service into the family liaison room. This room was specially set up for couples to meet up with a midwife to talk over events that may have been troubling or upsetting, such as an emergency caesarean or an unexpected intervention such as forceps delivery.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We can now offer a secure space through video to deliver this same service, which can help people better understand what has happened to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>There is no doubt that everyone is missing physical contact. Midwifery is a tactile profession &nbsp;but obviously we&nbsp;must&nbsp;be careful. When women come into hospital,&nbsp;we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;wear masks and gloves.</p>

                <p>It’s not normal and it is challenging, but the move to a video platform has been very positive and I’m sure we will continue to use it&nbsp;in the future.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>One-to-one appointments will continue to be important, but Lincolnshire is a very rural area and we have five peripheral clinics. Not everyone has a car and public transport is limited. If we can&nbsp;minimise&nbsp;that amount of travel, I think that will be of great benefit to our pregnant women.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The recent transition to an electronic maternity record&nbsp;is equally important, especially when appointments are held on the phone or over video calling. We’d be lost without them during this time. The maternity records also enable vital information to be shared with other hospitals and clinics. All our clinicians have access to our Maternity Information System wherever they are working from. That can only benefit a mum-to-be, who can give birth at any place, any time.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been very challenging but the technological adaptations we have had to make will be enduring in keeping us better connected.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>As well as rolling out Attend Anywhere to ante-natal clinics, we are extending the service into the family liaison room. This room was specially set up for couples to meet up with a midwife to talk over events that may have been troubling or upsetting, such as an emergency caesarean or an unexpected intervention such as forceps delivery.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We can now offer a secure space through video to deliver this same service, which can help people better understand what has happened to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>There is no doubt that everyone is missing physical contact. Midwifery is a tactile profession &nbsp;but obviously we&nbsp;must&nbsp;be careful. When women come into hospital,&nbsp;we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;wear masks and gloves.</p>

                <p>It’s not normal and it is challenging, but the move to a video platform has been very positive and I’m sure we will continue to use it&nbsp;in the future.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>One-to-one appointments will continue to be important, but Lincolnshire is a very rural area and we have five peripheral clinics. Not everyone has a car and public transport is limited. If we can&nbsp;minimise&nbsp;that amount of travel, I think that will be of great benefit to our pregnant women.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The recent transition to an electronic maternity record&nbsp;is equally important, especially when appointments are held on the phone or over video calling. We’d be lost without them during this time. The maternity records also enable vital information to be shared with other hospitals and clinics. All our clinicians have access to our Maternity Information System wherever they are working from. That can only benefit a mum-to-be, who can give birth at any place, any time.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been very challenging but the technological adaptations we have had to make will be enduring in keeping us better connected.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Just 10 days before lockdown began in March 2020, I joined the NHS Digital service manual team as a Product and Delivery Management Graduate. I had an expectation that I would only be working on the </strong><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/"><strong>NHS digital service manual</strong></a><strong>, with the opportunity to take the time to learn about it and develop my skills.</strong></p>

                <p>Instead, I was thrown in at the deep end and tasked with helping to design crucial digital services to help with the COVID-19 response, such as the <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/get-an-antigen-test-to-check-if-you-have-coronavirus/">coronavirus antigen testing service for the public on the NHS website</a>.</p>

                <p>Delivering projects at a pace I’m not used to and working with teams I hadn’t known for very long has been both challenging and rewarding. Being a product manager, and as someone new to building these services, the service manual was a crucial resource to help me understand all the tools the team uses to build consistent and accessible services.</p>

                <p><strong>Just 10 days before lockdown began in March 2020, I joined the NHS Digital service manual team as a Product and Delivery Management Graduate.

                <p>The pandemic was not on a roadmap. We could not plan for resources, anticipate user needs or have the privilege of time to plan and build products and services in response to it. User needs, as well as stakeholder requirements, have been rapidly evolving as the days, even hours, pass by.</p>

                <p><strong>Seeking health care for a patient with a learning disability was always a challenge even before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic upended all our lives.</strong></p>

                <p>People may need support from family members, friends or carers, but can be left without that familiar support due to social distancing. This may leave the individuals confused, agitated and anxious when getting treatment from unfamiliar staff in new and strange environments.</p>

                <p>Some organisations who have identified people’s specific needs, such as GPs, specialist community services and hospital liaison teams have recorded this and other relevant information in local systems to be made available when the patients are treated. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>However, this information isn’t always recorded consistently or shared with all the health and care staff who need to see it. Unfortunately, where these needs are not known, the impact can be significant.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We have been working with NHS England to help address this problem by developing a ‘<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag">Reasonable Adjustment Flag</a>’ on the NHS <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/spine">Spine</a>. The flag contains details of key adjustments to care for patients with a learning disability or autism.</p>

                <p>These key adjustments can include details of communication requirements or the need for additional support from staff or from people they know. If someone new is working with these patients, it’s really important they know these details.</p>

                <p>As we have been developing the Reasonable Adjustment Flag, we have spoken to patients, carers and health and care staff and come across many examples of seemingly small adjustments that can transform care for a service user.</p>

                <p>For instance, knowing that someone will become alarmed if their name is used, or if they have a fear of uniforms or certain physical objects, is critical. Bright lights and loud noises can often cause distress for someone who is autistic and can prompt a crisis. This could lead to their care appointment taking longer or not even happening at all.</p>

              hippostd:content: |-
                <p>The flag serves as an immediate alert. Reasonable adjustments may be recorded in local systems and in other records such as the <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-records-scr">Summary Care Record</a> (SCR), but they are often not always immediately available or visible to staff. A key aspect of the flag is that as soon as any member of staff looks at the Spine record, in reception for example, they can clearly see that that their service may need to be adjusted for this particular patient.</p>

                <p>This prompt is an early opportunity to review the information in the flag, view other clinical records or any other information such as <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/6cs/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2015/03/healthcare-passport.pdf">care passports</a> or crisis plans.</p>

                <p>The work also complements and extends the existing recording of adjustments. It is built using the existing standard for communication requirements as defined in the <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb1605-accessible-information">Accessible Information Standard DCB 1605</a> but expands that approach with new and existing adjustments in specific categories related to:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>additional support from staff, carers, family or friends</li>
                 <li>individual care requirements requiring changes to standard clinical or administrative processes and procedures</li>
                 <li>adjustments to the environment in which care is provided</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Health and care staff who are working with patients and carers to understand their needs and identify adjustments can review and learn from the existing example adjustments and categories.</p>

                <p>We also know that some specific adjustments cannot be fully defined by pre-existing codes. To overcome this issue, the flag uses a bespoke adjustment code. The detail of the adjustment is recorded in supporting free text so it can be tailored to provide information for truly personalised care.</p>

                <p>The flag has been built into <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-record-application">Summary Care Record applications</a> (SCRa), which also provides access to a patient’s SCR, and it sits alongside other critical information such as <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/child-protection-information-sharing-project">Child Protection Information Sharing</a> (CP-IS) and <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/female-genital-mutilation-information-sharing">Female Genital Mutilation – Information Sharing</a> (FGM-IS).</p>

                <p>This new capability has been piloted in Gloucestershire and Devon and users have commented that they like the simple, structured approach to recording and sharing details of the key adjustments. They want to see it integrated in their local systems. As a result, a software interface (<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-apis">FHIR</a> API) for clinical systems to integrate with the flag is being developed.</p>

Whilst the flag pilots focussed on patients with learning disability, the capability has been developed to include adjustments to care in relation to any relevant disability, impairment or long term condition. So, in the future the flag can also benefit a wide range of other vulnerable patient groups.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>It is expected that all health and care organisations are recording and sharing this key information to benefit their patients, especially since it has become even more critical during the coronavirus crisis.</p>

                <p><strong>Seeking health care for a patient with a learning disability was always a challenge even before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic upended all our lives.</strong></p>

                <p>People may need support from family members, friends or carers, but can be left without that familiar support due to social distancing. This may leave the individuals confused, agitated and anxious when getting treatment from unfamiliar staff in new and strange environments.</p>

                <p>Some organisations who have identified people’s specific needs, such as GPs, specialist community services and hospital liaison teams have recorded this and other relevant information in local systems to be made available when the patients are treated. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>However, this information isn’t always recorded consistently or shared with all the health and care staff who need to see it. Unfortunately, where these needs are not known, the impact can be significant.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We have been working with NHS England to help address this problem by developing a ‘<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reasonable-adjustment-flag">Reasonable Adjustment Flag</a>’ on the NHS <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/spine">Spine</a>. The flag contains details of key adjustments to care for patients with a learning disability or autism.</p>

                <p>These key adjustments can include details of communication requirements or the need for additional support from staff or from people they know. If someone new is working with these patients, it’s really important they know these details.</p>

                <p>As we have been developing the Reasonable Adjustment Flag, we have spoken to patients, carers and health and care staff and come across many examples of seemingly small adjustments that can transform care for a service user.</p>

                <p>For instance, knowing that someone will become alarmed if their name is used, or if they have a fear of uniforms or certain physical objects, is critical. Bright lights and loud noises can often cause distress for someone who is autistic and can prompt a crisis. This could lead to their care appointment taking longer or not even happening at all.</p>

              hippostd:content: |-
                <p>The flag serves as an immediate alert. Reasonable adjustments may be recorded in local systems and in other records such as the <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-records-scr">Summary Care Record</a> (SCR), but they are often not always immediately available or visible to staff. A key aspect of the flag is that as soon as any member of staff looks at the Spine record, in reception for example, they can clearly see that that their service may need to be adjusted for this particular patient.</p>

                <p>This prompt is an early opportunity to review the information in the flag, view other clinical records or any other information such as <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/6cs/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2015/03/healthcare-passport.pdf">care passports</a> or crisis plans.</p>

                <p>The work also complements and extends the existing recording of adjustments. It is built using the existing standard for communication requirements as defined in the <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb1605-accessible-information">Accessible Information Standard DCB 1605</a> but expands that approach with new and existing adjustments in specific categories related to:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>additional support from staff, carers, family or friends</li>
                 <li>individual care requirements requiring changes to standard clinical or administrative processes and procedures</li>
                 <li>adjustments to the environment in which care is provided</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Health and care staff who are working with patients and carers to understand their needs and identify adjustments can review and learn from the existing example adjustments and categories.</p>

                <p>We also know that some specific adjustments cannot be fully defined by pre-existing codes. To overcome this issue, the flag uses a bespoke adjustment code. The detail of the adjustment is recorded in supporting free text so it can be tailored to provide information for truly personalised care.</p>

                <p>The flag has been built into <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-record-application">Summary Care Record applications</a> (SCRa), which also provides access to a patient’s SCR, and it sits alongside other critical information such as <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/child-protection-information-sharing-project">Child Protection Information Sharing</a> (CP-IS) and <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/female-genital-mutilation-information-sharing">Female Genital Mutilation – Information Sharing</a> (FGM-IS).</p>

                <p>This new capability has been piloted in Gloucestershire and Devon and users have commented that they like the simple, structured approach to recording and sharing details of the key adjustments. They want to see it integrated in their local systems. As a result, a software interface (<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-apis">FHIR</a> API) for clinical systems to integrate with the flag is being developed.</p>

Reasonable adjustments may be recorded in local systems and in other records such as the <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-records-scr">Summary Care Record</a> (SCR), but they are often not always immediately available or visible to staff. A key aspect of the flag is that as soon as any member of staff looks at the Spine record, in reception for example, they can clearly see that that their service may need to be adjusted for this particular patient.</p>

                <p>This prompt is an early opportunity to review the information in the flag, view other clinical records or any other information such as <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/6cs/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2015/03/healthcare-passport.pdf">care passports</a> or crisis plans.</p>

                <p>The work also complements and extends the existing recording of adjustments. It is built using the existing standard for communication requirements as defined in the <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb1605-accessible-information">Accessible Information Standard DCB 1605</a> but expands that approach with new and existing adjustments in specific categories related to:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>additional support from staff, carers, family or friends</li>
                 <li>individual care requirements requiring changes to standard clinical or administrative processes and procedures</li>
                 <li>adjustments to the environment in which care is provided</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Health and care staff who are working with patients and carers to understand their needs and identify adjustments can review and learn from the existing example adjustments and categories.</p>

                <p>We also know that some specific adjustments cannot be fully defined by pre-existing codes. To overcome this issue, the flag uses a bespoke adjustment code. The detail of the adjustment is recorded in supporting free text so it can be tailored to provide information for truly personalised care.</p>

                <p>The flag has been built into <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-record-application">Summary Care Record applications</a> (SCRa), which also provides access to a patient’s SCR, and it sits alongside other critical information such as <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/child-protection-information-sharing-project">Child Protection Information Sharing</a> (CP-IS) and <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/female-genital-mutilation-information-sharing">Female Genital Mutilation – Information Sharing</a> (FGM-IS).</p>

                <p>This new capability has been piloted in Gloucestershire and Devon and users have commented that they like the simple, structured approach to recording and sharing details of the key adjustments. They want to see it integrated in their local systems. As a result, a software interface (<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-apis">FHIR</a> API) for clinical systems to integrate with the flag is being developed.</p>

                <p><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.mencap.org.uk/learning-disability-explained/research-and-statistics/health/health-inequalities">Mencap have done much work to highlight the health inequalities experienced by patients with learning disability</a> – including that their median age of death is over 20 years less than for other members of the population. Whilst the flag pilots focussed on patients with learning disability, the capability has been developed to include adjustments to care in relation to any relevant disability, impairment or long term condition. So, in the future the flag can also benefit a wide range of other vulnerable patient groups.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>It is expected that all health and care organisations are recording and sharing this key information to benefit their patients, especially since it has become even more critical during the coronavirus crisis.</p>

                <p><strong>On 21 March the Government issued <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">guidance on shielding and protecting people</a> who, on medical grounds, are considered extremely vulnerable to COVID-19.</strong></p>

                <p>As part of this, the NHS identified the need to communicate the very latest, reliable information directly to these people, so they can use it to protect themselves and self-isolate effectively.</p>

                <p>We know from research conducted by the <a href="https://www.bi.team/">Behavioural Insights Team</a> (BIT) that people want to receive messages from trusted sources in this way. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>A small group working across national organisations - from NHSX, NHS Digital, NHS Business Services Authority and the BIT - was quickly stood up last week to develop the new text messaging service that would deliver this information. This service is part of a Vulnerable, Isolated and Social Care team, which is looking at how we use technology to support these people.</p>

                <p>As a result, from Monday 23 March, daily text messages are being sent to over 1 million people who have been identified by the NHS in England as needing to protect themselves by self-isolating for at least 12 weeks because they are extremely vulnerable to COVID-19. This group includes people who have had organ transplants, have certain types of cancers, or have significant respiratory conditions.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The text messages will be sent by the NHS and will include:&nbsp;<br />

                <p>Messages will be sent daily between 23 March and 29 March, and we will review this as we go. We will be able to extend the text messaging service if we need to.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The text content, created by the NHS, directs recipients to further sources of information on the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">NHS website</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">gov.uk</a>. These sites are being updated regularly. People can opt out from the service if they want by replying “stop” to any message.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>One of our concerns was that the texts may be treated as spam by some recipients. They have been designed so that they are clearly from the NHS and government. Their intent and purpose is to provide useful information directly to people through an easy-to-use channel. This is not about ‘direct marketing’ but about effective, modern public health communication using the latest technology to facilitate safe and speedy support and advice.<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
                We are not limiting our support to this channel. Letters will also be sent from NHS England, including to people whose mobile numbers we don’t have.</p>

                <p>We began work on this just over a week ago, and standing up a service to such a tight deadline has been challenging. The key to working quickly has been keeping all of the organisations and individuals involved well coordinated and in close touch. Clinicians, digital and technology professionals, behavioural scientists and communication professionals have all worked together at pace to make this the best possible service for people in need of support.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>I’m grateful for the hard work of everyone involved. It will play an important part in keeping some of the people most vulnerable to COVID-19 safe during this outbreak.</p>

                <p><strong>On 21 March the Government issued <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">guidance on shielding and protecting people</a> who, on medical grounds, are considered extremely vulnerable to COVID-19.</strong></p>

                <p>As part of this, the NHS identified the need to communicate the very latest, reliable information directly to these people, so they can use it to protect themselves and self-isolate effectively.</p>

                <p>We know from research conducted by the <a href="https://www.bi.team/">Behavioural Insights Team</a> (BIT) that people want to receive messages from trusted sources in this way. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>A small group working across national organisations - from NHSX, NHS Digital, NHS Business Services Authority and the BIT - was quickly stood up last week to develop the new text messaging service that would deliver this information. This service is part of a Vulnerable, Isolated and Social Care team, which is looking at how we use technology to support these people.</p>

                <p>As a result, from Monday 23 March, daily text messages are being sent to over 1 million people who have been identified by the NHS in England as needing to protect themselves by self-isolating for at least 12 weeks because they are extremely vulnerable to COVID-19. This group includes people who have had organ transplants, have certain types of cancers, or have significant respiratory conditions.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The text messages will be sent by the NHS and will include:&nbsp;<br />

                <p>Messages will be sent daily between 23 March and 29 March, and we will review this as we go. We will be able to extend the text messaging service if we need to.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The text content, created by the NHS, directs recipients to further sources of information on the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">NHS website</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">gov.uk</a>. These sites are being updated regularly. People can opt out from the service if they want by replying “stop” to any message.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>One of our concerns was that the texts may be treated as spam by some recipients. They have been designed so that they are clearly from the NHS and government. Their intent and purpose is to provide useful information directly to people through an easy-to-use channel. This is not about ‘direct marketing’ but about effective, modern public health communication using the latest technology to facilitate safe and speedy support and advice.<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
                We are not limiting our support to this channel. Letters will also be sent from NHS England, including to people whose mobile numbers we don’t have.</p>

                <p>We began work on this just over a week ago, and standing up a service to such a tight deadline has been challenging. The key to working quickly has been keeping all of the organisations and individuals involved well coordinated and in close touch. Clinicians, digital and technology professionals, behavioural scientists and communication professionals have all worked together at pace to make this the best possible service for people in need of support.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>I’m grateful for the hard work of everyone involved. It will play an important part in keeping some of the people most vulnerable to COVID-19 safe during this outbreak.</p>

                <p><strong><span><span><span><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-login"><span>NHS login</span></a><span> is a single, secure login that enables you to swiftly access health and social care apps and websites wherever you see the NHS login button. It was first introduced with the NHS App in September 2018. Since then, more than 384,000 people have now set up an NHS login, 214,000 of which have gone on to verify their identity. These numbers are growing every day.</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>But NHS login is much more than the way you log&nbsp;in to the NHS App. It is one of the keys to changing people’s experience of digital health services: a single login that gives individuals secure access to multiple NHS digital services and helps those services to link together. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>In many ways, it is similar to your Google or Apple account – and it will have the same potential to support simple and secure use of interlocking digital tools.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>We first worked with four digital services, who are now live with NHS login, to co-design a process that took developers from initial exploration of NHS login to integration in live services. </span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>We worked closely with these initial four organisations, running weekly catch-up calls and checkpoints, but quickly learned this wouldn’t be sustainable when dealing with a large number of services – we needed to move to a more self-service approach. The first four told us that emails and phone calls on an ad hoc basis are&nbsp;sufficient when combined with the information that we host on GitHub and our developer chat channel Slack, so that’s our approach to communication now.</span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>Another key thing we all learned is that testing out NHS login user journeys in the sandpit is crucial. The sandpit<span><span> is a copy of our live production code environment that helps partners learn how to integrate with our service.</span></span> </span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>Initial go-live with NHS login worked well when developers explored, tested and worked through the end-to-end user journeys between their service and ours in the sandpit. When this didn’t happen, go-live was less successful. Learning from this, the new self-service model requires developers to connect and explore the NHS login journeys in the sandpit before we begin the integration process together. </span></span></span></span></p>

We’ve had lots of useful feedback from this cohort, making us confident that the toolkit is suitable for wider use.</span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Everyone agreed that a benefit of the toolkit was allowing developers to set their own pace and drive their work forward themselves. This streamlines the process, frees up capacity in our team and allows us to work with several services at once while still being able to respond quickly to any challenges they faced. </span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Feedback from one supplier was that the NHS login integration process has a real sense of purpose and urgency on both sides, which was very gratifying. We were also told by another supplier that it’s been a breath of fresh air working in this way, and that they were pleasantly surprised at the responsiveness of the NHS login team. Needless to say, our team is very happy with how the self-service approach is working for everyone.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><strong><span><span><span><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-login"><span>NHS login</span></a><span> is a single, secure login that enables you to swiftly access health and social care apps and websites wherever you see the NHS login button. It was first introduced with the NHS App in September 2018. Since then, more than 384,000 people have now set up an NHS login, 214,000 of which have gone on to verify their identity. These numbers are growing every day.</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>But NHS login is much more than the way you log&nbsp;in to the NHS App. It is one of the keys to changing people’s experience of digital health services: a single login that gives individuals secure access to multiple NHS digital services and helps those services to link together. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>In many ways, it is similar to your Google or Apple account – and it will have the same potential to support simple and secure use of interlocking digital tools.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>We first worked with four digital services, who are now live with NHS login, to co-design a process that took developers from initial exploration of NHS login to integration in live services. </span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>We worked closely with these initial four organisations, running weekly catch-up calls and checkpoints, but quickly learned this wouldn’t be sustainable when dealing with a large number of services – we needed to move to a more self-service approach. The first four told us that emails and phone calls on an ad hoc basis are&nbsp;sufficient when combined with the information that we host on GitHub and our developer chat channel Slack, so that’s our approach to communication now.</span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>Another key thing we all learned is that testing out NHS login user journeys in the sandpit is crucial. The sandpit<span><span> is a copy of our live production code environment that helps partners learn how to integrate with our service.</span></span> </span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>Initial go-live with NHS login worked well when developers explored, tested and worked through the end-to-end user journeys between their service and ours in the sandpit. When this didn’t happen, go-live was less successful. Learning from this, the new self-service model requires developers to connect and explore the NHS login journeys in the sandpit before we begin the integration process together. </span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>From this learning, we developed a </span><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-login/nhs-login-for-partners-and-developers/nhs-login-integration-toolkit"><span>self-service toolkit</span></a><span> that developers of digital services could use to get started. </span><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/news-and-events/latest-news/nine-new-tools-and-services-to-use-nhs-login"><span>We selected nine new services</span></a><span> to test this approach to onboarding. Four months later,&nbsp;seven of them are now live with NHS login. We’ve had lots of useful feedback from this cohort, making us confident that the toolkit is suitable for wider use.</span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Everyone agreed that a benefit of the toolkit was allowing developers to set their own pace and drive their work forward themselves. This streamlines the process, frees up capacity in our team and allows us to work with several services at once while still being able to respond quickly to any challenges they faced. </span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Feedback from one supplier was that the NHS login integration process has a real sense of purpose and urgency on both sides, which was very gratifying. We were also told by another supplier that it’s been a breath of fresh air working in this way, and that they were pleasantly surprised at the responsiveness of the NHS login team. Needless to say, our team is very happy with how the self-service approach is working for everyone.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><strong><span><span><span><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-login"><span>NHS login</span></a><span> is a single, secure login that enables you to swiftly access health and social care apps and websites wherever you see the NHS login button. It was first introduced with the NHS App in September 2018. Since then, more than 384,000 people have now set up an NHS login, 214,000 of which have gone on to verify their identity. These numbers are growing every day.</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>But NHS login is much more than the way you log&nbsp;in to the NHS App. It is one of the keys to changing people’s experience of digital health services: a single login that gives individuals secure access to multiple NHS digital services and helps those services to link together. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>In many ways, it is similar to your Google or Apple account – and it will have the same potential to support simple and secure use of interlocking digital tools.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>We first worked with four digital services, who are now live with NHS login, to co-design a process that took developers from initial exploration of NHS login to integration in live services. </span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>We worked closely with these initial four organisations, running weekly catch-up calls and checkpoints, but quickly learned this wouldn’t be sustainable when dealing with a large number of services – we needed to move to a more self-service approach. The first four told us that emails and phone calls on an ad hoc basis are&nbsp;sufficient when combined with the information that we host on GitHub and our developer chat channel Slack, so that’s our approach to communication now.</span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>Another key thing we all learned is that testing out NHS login user journeys in the sandpit is crucial. The sandpit<span><span> is a copy of our live production code environment that helps partners learn how to integrate with our service.</span></span> </span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>Initial go-live with NHS login worked well when developers explored, tested and worked through the end-to-end user journeys between their service and ours in the sandpit. When this didn’t happen, go-live was less successful. Learning from this, the new self-service model requires developers to connect and explore the NHS login journeys in the sandpit before we begin the integration process together. </span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span>From this learning, we developed a </span><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-login/nhs-login-for-partners-and-developers/nhs-login-integration-toolkit"><span>self-service toolkit</span></a><span> that developers of digital services could use to get started. </span><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/news-and-events/latest-news/nine-new-tools-and-services-to-use-nhs-login"><span>We selected nine new services</span></a><span> to test this approach to onboarding. Four months later,&nbsp;seven of them are now live with NHS login. We’ve had lots of useful feedback from this cohort, making us confident that the toolkit is suitable for wider use.</span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Everyone agreed that a benefit of the toolkit was allowing developers to set their own pace and drive their work forward themselves. This streamlines the process, frees up capacity in our team and allows us to work with several services at once while still being able to respond quickly to any challenges they faced. </span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Feedback from one supplier was that the NHS login integration process has a real sense of purpose and urgency on both sides, which was very gratifying. We were also told by another supplier that it’s been a breath of fresh air working in this way, and that they were pleasantly surprised at the responsiveness of the NHS login team. Needless to say, our team is very happy with how the self-service approach is working for everyone.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><strong>For the past three years, I have split&nbsp;my week between seeing patients as a child and adolescent psychiatrist and working as the senior clinical lead for data at NHS Digital. This has given me a unique perspective on how two fantastic teams help patients. I have sometimes found it hard to persuade my team at NHS Digital how much impact their work has on patients.</strong></p>

                <p>The truth is that analysts, data scientists and the other professionals who support them play a crucial role in making it possible for clinicians to work effectively.</p>

                <p>The NHS has some of the richest health data assets in the world. These are used by a range of people – researchers, doctors, government bodies, charities – to improve our health. People don’t always realise that getting the right data, in the right place, at the right time, can have just as much impact as a prescription or a medical procedure.</p>

                <p>In the UK, we probably have the world’s longest and proudest tradition of using data to improve health. One of our earliest and most effective clinical informaticians was <a href="https://www.florence-nightingale.co.uk/">Florence Nightingale</a>. Her examination of the causes of death of British soldiers stationed in Crimea and her highly effective deployment of this data and analysis revolutionised practice. She helped create the modern hospital. Her suggested changes in care, including mandatory hand-washing,&nbsp;are still critical today.</p>

                <p>Data extracted from many records and analysed at both national and local levels helps us to understand more about health and disease, improve public health through targeted interventions, monitor safety, and plan and deliver health and social care services more effectively. For this to happen, data needs to be collected in a high quality (accurate and complete), consistent (comparable), safe and legal way.</p>

                <p>Nationally, NHS Digital is the safe-haven for patient data and is legally accountable for the collection, storing and use of patient data for research on behalf of the health and care system. We publish over 200 statistical reports a year.</p>

                <p>We conducted a Clinical Review to discover how people were using our data (ranging from the number of emergency hospital emissions through to patient reported outcome measures) and what impact that had on patients as well as the health and care system.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We have not always been good at measuring the impact and we had never conducted a review of this type before. &nbsp;We were therefore keen to do so and examine the feedback to see how we could improve what we are doing.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Our new Data Processing Services (DPS) platform, which went live last year, can manage larger volumes of data faster than ever before.

                <p>It also allows us to create a richer and broader data set because the consistent de-identification process (ensuring patients’ identities are not revealed) lets us link data across different care settings and geographical boundaries.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We make anonymised data available through downloads, dashboards and sector specific data hubs, such as the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/general-practice-data-hub">General Practice Data Hub</a>. We now have over 50 interactive dashboards on our website which are open and free for anyone to access. There is a vast array of data available and our biggest challenge is being aware and focussed on what the needs of our users are.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We have therefore worked hard with user researchers to ensure they are easy to understand for everyone.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In future we will enable access through application programming interfaces (APIs) to make the data more easily accessible by other applications.</p>

                <p>At the same time, our data science team are working to enhance routine analysis and will build partnerships with others, such as <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">the Alan Turing Institute</a>, to enable advanced analytics across the system.</p>

                <p><strong>For the past three years, I have split&nbsp;my week between seeing patients as a child and adolescent psychiatrist and working as the senior clinical lead for data at NHS Digital. This has given me a unique perspective on how two fantastic teams help patients. I have sometimes found it hard to persuade my team at NHS Digital how much impact their work has on patients.</strong></p>

                <p>The truth is that analysts, data scientists and the other professionals who support them play a crucial role in making it possible for clinicians to work effectively.</p>

                <p>The NHS has some of the richest health data assets in the world. These are used by a range of people – researchers, doctors, government bodies, charities – to improve our health. People don’t always realise that getting the right data, in the right place, at the right time, can have just as much impact as a prescription or a medical procedure.</p>

                <p>In the UK, we probably have the world’s longest and proudest tradition of using data to improve health. One of our earliest and most effective clinical informaticians was <a href="https://www.florence-nightingale.co.uk/">Florence Nightingale</a>. Her examination of the causes of death of British soldiers stationed in Crimea and her highly effective deployment of this data and analysis revolutionised practice. She helped create the modern hospital. Her suggested changes in care, including mandatory hand-washing,&nbsp;are still critical today.</p>

                <p>Data extracted from many records and analysed at both national and local levels helps us to understand more about health and disease, improve public health through targeted interventions, monitor safety, and plan and deliver health and social care services more effectively. For this to happen, data needs to be collected in a high quality (accurate and complete), consistent (comparable), safe and legal way.</p>

                <p>Nationally, NHS Digital is the safe-haven for patient data and is legally accountable for the collection, storing and use of patient data for research on behalf of the health and care system. We publish over 200 statistical reports a year.</p>

                <p>We conducted a Clinical Review to discover how people were using our data (ranging from the number of emergency hospital emissions through to patient reported outcome measures) and what impact that had on patients as well as the health and care system.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We have not always been good at measuring the impact and we had never conducted a review of this type before. &nbsp;We were therefore keen to do so and examine the feedback to see how we could improve what we are doing.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>For the past three years, I have split&nbsp;my week between seeing patients as a child and adolescent psychiatrist and working as the senior clinical lead for data at NHS Digital. This has given me a unique perspective on how two fantastic teams help patients. I have sometimes found it hard to persuade my team at NHS Digital how much impact their work has on patients.</strong></p>

                <p>The truth is that analysts, data scientists and the other professionals who support them play a crucial role in making it possible for clinicians to work effectively.</p>

                <p>The NHS has some of the richest health data assets in the world. These are used by a range of people – researchers, doctors, government bodies, charities – to improve our health. People don’t always realise that getting the right data, in the right place, at the right time, can have just as much impact as a prescription or a medical procedure.</p>

                <p>In the UK, we probably have the world’s longest and proudest tradition of using data to improve health. One of our earliest and most effective clinical informaticians was <a href="https://www.florence-nightingale.co.uk/">Florence Nightingale</a>. Her examination of the causes of death of British soldiers stationed in Crimea and her highly effective deployment of this data and analysis revolutionised practice. She helped create the modern hospital. Her suggested changes in care, including mandatory hand-washing,&nbsp;are still critical today.</p>

                <p>Data extracted from many records and analysed at both national and local levels helps us to understand more about health and disease, improve public health through targeted interventions, monitor safety, and plan and deliver health and social care services more effectively. For this to happen, data needs to be collected in a high quality (accurate and complete), consistent (comparable), safe and legal way.</p>

                <p>Nationally, NHS Digital is the safe-haven for patient data and is legally accountable for the collection, storing and use of patient data for research on behalf of the health and care system. We publish over 200 statistical reports a year.</p>

                <p>We conducted a Clinical Review to discover how people were using our data (ranging from the number of emergency hospital emissions through to patient reported outcome measures) and what impact that had on patients as well as the health and care system.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We have not always been good at measuring the impact and we had never conducted a review of this type before. &nbsp;We were therefore keen to do so and examine the feedback to see how we could improve what we are doing.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Sophisticated use of data is set to become more and more central to the organisation and development of our health system.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Our new Data Processing Services (DPS) platform, which went live last year, can manage larger volumes of data faster than ever before. Cloud technology makes it more secure and allows a greater range of providers to submit their data to us. It eliminates burdens on data providers by linking data sets and ensuring they don’t have to submit the same information for more than one collection.</p>

                <p>It also allows us to create a richer and broader data set because the consistent de-identification process (ensuring patients’ identities are not revealed) lets us link data across different care settings and geographical boundaries.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We make anonymised data available through downloads, dashboards and sector specific data hubs, such as the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/general-practice-data-hub">General Practice Data Hub</a>. We now have over 50 interactive dashboards on our website which are open and free for anyone to access. There is a vast array of data available and our biggest challenge is being aware and focussed on what the needs of our users are.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We have therefore worked hard with user researchers to ensure they are easy to understand for everyone.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In future we will enable access through application programming interfaces (APIs) to make the data more easily accessible by other applications.</p>

                <p>At the same time, our data science team are working to enhance routine analysis and will build partnerships with others, such as <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">the Alan Turing Institute</a>, to enable advanced analytics across the system.</p>

                <p>One aspect of this work concerns using machine learning techniques to build predictive models There is an increasing awareness of the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform care and <a href="https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2019/08/08/introducing-nhsxs-new-national-artificial-intelligence-laboratory/">an NHS AI lab was launched in August last year</a> by NHSX.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>For example, we are looking at how we can help predict non-attendance at out-patient appointments. This would enable trusts to optimise use of scarce resources and follow-up with patients, so they get the care they need when they need it.</p>

                <p>We are also exploring machine learning to extract medical knowledge within free-text notes. These are notes that are usually typed or dictated by clinicians and although obviously useful to the practitioners, are less suitable for secondary use by researchers who want to track trends and understand demand on a wider scale.</p>

                <p>Many organisations are seeing data driving more proactive and personalised services. The <a href="https://ukhealthdata.org/">UK Health Data Research Alliance</a> was created to unite expertise and to ensure there is an ethical and consistent approach to the use of data, that it is of high quality and that patients trust us to use their data responsibly.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The Alliance members include NHS England, NHS Digital and Public Health England as well as NHS Trusts, charities and professional bodies. The goal is clearly to build a more innovative health and care system that is trusted and secure and works for us all.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-insights-and-statistics/dars-clinical-review">full clinical review report</a> is available on the NHS Digital website.</p>

                <p><strong>I come from a family of doctors, nurses and social workers so the NHS has always been a priority for me. There are few places where it is more important to ensure our cyber defences are strong.</strong></p>

                <p>I first worked with the NHS as Director of Incident Management at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) at the time of the WannaCry incident, which was a fascinating, but also a worrying experience. Though the attack was not targeted specifically at the NHS, we are all aware of the impact it had.</p>

                <p>As the weekly <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/keep-up-to-date/threat-reports?q=&amp;defaultTypes=report&amp;sort=date%2Bdesc&amp;start=0&amp;rows=20">NCSC threat report</a> highlights, we should be in no doubt that there are groups and individuals who want to target the NHS and other healthcare organisations.&nbsp; Of great concern are ransomware attacks mounted by large and sophisticated criminal groups.</p>

                <p>If a vulnerability is reported in a trust, approved commercial companies can offer on-site support much quicker under a contract operated by our Data Security Centre, giving the trusts and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) the additional resource and expertise they may need to defend themselves.</p>

                <p><strong>I come from a family of doctors, nurses and social workers so the NHS has always been a priority for me. There are few places where it is more important to ensure our cyber defences are strong.</strong></p>

                <p>I first worked with the NHS as Director of Incident Management at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) at the time of the WannaCry incident, which was a fascinating, but also a worrying experience. Though the attack was not targeted specifically at the NHS, we are all aware of the impact it had.</p>

                <p>As the weekly <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/keep-up-to-date/threat-reports?q=&amp;defaultTypes=report&amp;sort=date%2Bdesc&amp;start=0&amp;rows=20">NCSC threat report</a> highlights, we should be in no doubt that there are groups and individuals who want to target the NHS and other healthcare organisations.&nbsp; Of great concern are ransomware attacks mounted by large and sophisticated criminal groups.</p>

                <p>These have already impacted many organisations, including hospitals and companies who are within the NHS's supply chain. A significant ransomware attack in the current climate would have major implications for the healthcare system, so that's the area we are particularly focussed on.</p>

                <p>But we must also be prepared for other hostile actors. There are always going to be more opportunities for business email fraud when people are working remotely, and we are seeing an increase in lower-level criminals using the coronavirus crisis to exploit that&nbsp;fact.</p>

                <p>As the Director of GCHQ recently explained, there are also nation states who are using cyber during the pandemic to promote their national interest. The importance of ensuring that critical NHS systems remain available has never been greater.</p>

                <p>In the WannaCry aftermath, a lot of criticism was levelled at the NHS, but I think it's important to remember how difficult it can be in any organisation, but particularly in healthcare, to strike the right balance between security, usability and cost.</p>

                 <li>a network of Cyber Associates to own and advise on cyber security within the NHS, with over 1,000 members in 700 NHS organisations</li>
                 <li>the <a href="https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/">Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT)</a>, which means that all NHS and social care organisations are working towards the same national standards</li>
                 <li>the creation of regional leads to support local delivery of cyber security</li>
                 <li>the provision of licences to enable all NHS Trusts to upgrade to Windows 10, a key part of which is the provision of Microsoft’s <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-and-data-security/managing-security/advanced-threat-protection-from-microsoft">Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)</a>. This now provides endpoint security across 1.3 million connected devices, giving the NHS a view on cyber threat status and vulnerabilities, both locally and nationally.</li>
                 <li>NHS Digital also launched <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-and-data-security/managing-security/nhs-secure-boundary">NHS Secure Boundary</a>, a centrally funded solution that protects NHS organisations from the most sophisticated cyber threats</li>

                <p><strong>Ever since the coronavirus pandemic hit the nation, hundreds of thousands of people have been turning to the NHS website to find out more about the virus, what the symptoms are&nbsp;and how to deal with the illness.</strong></p>

                <p>But guidance and advice changes rapidly and it takes time and resource to stay up-to-date. We also knew that people were seeking health information in many places other than the NHS website (NHS.uk).</p>

                <p>Even before the COVID-19 crisis, we ensured that as many people as possible could find the right health information wherever they looked by syndicating NHS website content to over 2,000 users, who publish it in other websites and apps.</p>

                <p>We are collecting data on uses of the coronavirus syndication tools. Since their launch on 2 April 2020, the tools have been used on the websites of nearly 200 organisations.</p>

                <p>Users have found the tools simple and straightforward to use, such as Wessex Voices which was formed from five local Healthwatch organisations coming together in the Hampshire and Dorset area with NHS England Wessex. This is an initiative that aims to make sure local people are involved in designing and commissioning health services and they produce resources to support that aim.</p>

                <p>Another organisation, Machew LLP, a company that specialises in managing websites including several school websites, found that their customers "were very happy to have official, up-to-date information on their websites, and know that the NHS widget would automatically update as the COVID-19 situation changes".</p>

                <p>Mumsnet is probably one of the bigger, more well-known sites that are syndicating copy from the NHS website. It’s good to know that the information we are providing and they are using is as accurate as we can make it at any given time.</p>

                <p>We are collecting data on uses of the coronavirus syndication tools. Since their launch on 2 April 2020, the tools have been used on the websites of nearly 200 organisations.</p>

                <p>Users have found the tools simple and straightforward to use, such as Wessex Voices which was formed from five local Healthwatch organisations coming together in the Hampshire and Dorset area with NHS England Wessex. This is an initiative that aims to make sure local people are involved in designing and commissioning health services and they produce resources to support that aim.</p>

                <p><strong>Ever since the coronavirus pandemic hit the nation, hundreds of thousands of people have been turning to the NHS website to find out more about the virus, what the symptoms are&nbsp;and how to deal with the illness.</strong></p>

                <p>But guidance and advice changes rapidly and it takes time and resource to stay up-to-date. We also knew that people were seeking health information in many places other than the NHS website (NHS.uk).</p>

                <p>Even before the COVID-19 crisis, we ensured that as many people as possible could find the right health information wherever they looked by syndicating NHS website content to over 2,000 users, who publish it in other websites and apps.</p>

                <p>We quickly realised that demand was escalating on a huge scale as coronavirus hit us, so our team decided to create a group of tools to help users to quickly and easily reuse <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">NHS.uk coronavirus content</a>, and keep that content automatically updated.</p>

                <p>We want the clinically approved information on the NHS website&nbsp;to be disseminated as widely as possible so we have taken the step of allowing our users to bypass the usual sign-up process – although we do expect them to tell us how they are using the content.</p>

When an incident occurs, we liaise with the local NHS organisation to help the IT security professionals on the ground in tackling these incidents. One of the tools we use is Microsoft Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), which improves security of endpoint devices and networks across a large proportion of the NHS estate.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>There are over a million endpoint devices enrolled onto ATP in the NHS across England. When alerts are fired, we investigate and, if necessary, raise them to the organisation and provide support.

                <p>It was exciting for me to work in the CSOC, knowing that I was helping to monitor networks that are vital to protecting the NHS against a real cyber threat. I was very proud to become a trusted and reliable member of the CSOC, so being offered a full-time position in this role made the last two years of hard work feel extremely worthwhile.</p>

                <p>My apprenticeship also included 12 weeks of cyber security training courses, covering topics such as malware analysis, cyber operations and penetration testing. These courses broadened my knowledge of cyber security and helped me with my day-to-day responsibilities, especially with my time in the Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC).</p>

                <p>I've also had the opportunity to speak at events and run awaydays for other apprentices across similar government schemes. Two years ago, I could not have imagined anything I would rather do less than putting myself in front of a room full of people to deliver a talk .The apprenticeship has pushed me out of my comfort zone, and as a result I've been able to develop many new skills. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>In my new role as a cyber security advisor I’ll continue to build my knowledge of our monitoring solutions and I want to push myself to learn Python as this is a big part of processing my team’s threat intelligence feeds. I will also be playing a key part in monitoring the network traffic for <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-security-centre/developing-perimeter-security-for-the-estate">NHS Secure Boundary, a perimeter security solution which protects against the most sophisticated security threats for NHS organisations,</a> once it is all onboarded.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
                The best advice I could give to someone starting out as an apprentice, or to anyone who is considering it, would be to come into it with enthusiasm and willingness to learn. Being proactive about work and fearless when asking for help is key - there really is no such thing as a stupid question. &nbsp;I was initially a bit nervous to ask questions, worrying that I might sound stupid or that colleagues would not have any time for me. However, the reality is just the opposite and once I realised this, it helped me become the cyber security professional I wanted to be.&nbsp;<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
                With the right mindset and an eagerness to learn you have the potential to make a real impact in the workplace. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>In my new role as a cyber security advisor I’ll continue to build my knowledge of our monitoring solutions and I want to push myself to learn Python as this is a big part of processing my team’s threat intelligence feeds. I will also be playing a key part in monitoring the network traffic for <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-security-centre/developing-perimeter-security-for-the-estate">NHS Secure Boundary, a perimeter security solution which protects against the most sophisticated security threats for NHS organisations,</a> once it is all onboarded.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
                The best advice I could give to someone starting out as an apprentice, or to anyone who is considering it, would be to come into it with enthusiasm and willingness to learn. Being proactive about work and fearless when asking for help is key - there really is no such thing as a stupid question. &nbsp;I was initially a bit nervous to ask questions, worrying that I might sound stupid or that colleagues would not have any time for me. However, the reality is just the opposite and once I realised this, it helped me become the cyber security professional I wanted to be.&nbsp;<br />
                &nbsp;<br />
                With the right mindset and an eagerness to learn you have the potential to make a real impact in the workplace. &nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Choosing an apprenticeship route over university and other options post A-Levels can be a very daunting prospect, especially in a technical field like cyber security. I'd like to tell you a bit about my experience of being a cyber apprentice at NHS Digital, and how it has helped me get to where I am now.</strong></p>

                <p>I joined NHS Digital at the end of 2017 through a cross-government scheme after completing an IT networking diploma at college. The scheme required me to take numerous tests and interviews, just like those found on a graduate scheme. But for me, 18 at the time, this was all very new. &nbsp;<br />

                <p>My first few weeks were quite nerve-racking, being the youngest person in the office and being new to the workplace. However the support from my new colleagues helped me settle in quickly, and they were able to answer any of my questions, no matter what that subject was.</p>

                <p>It could be a technical question about cyber operations, or on a simple process that’s common in the workplace. My department always had the time for me when I reached out, helping to build my confidence at work.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>I had three main rotations within the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-security-centre">Data Security Centre at NHS Digital,</a> to experience all elements of its cyber capability, and to discover what work would suit me. These rotations were in the Specialist Security Services (S3), Innovation &amp; Delivery, and the Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC). S3 and Innovation &amp; Delivery were extremely valuable rotations for my growth as an apprentice and young cyber professional but working in the CSOC was the most enjoyable aspect, and I realised that this area was where I want to pursue my career. &nbsp;<br />

                <p>In the CSOC, I am part of the team responsible for monitoring the national NHS networks against cyber security threats. When an incident occurs, we liaise with the local NHS organisation to help the IT security professionals on the ground in tackling these incidents. One of the tools we use is Microsoft Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), which improves security of endpoint devices and networks across a large proportion of the NHS estate.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>There are over a million endpoint devices enrolled onto ATP in the NHS across England. When alerts are fired, we investigate and, if necessary, raise them to the organisation and provide support. We also provide an Information Sharing Portal (ISP), which has accurate, up to date cyber security information on threats, vulnerabilities and remedial action that is sent out to staff in the NHS via a weekly bulletin.</p>

I was very proud to become a trusted and reliable member of the CSOC, so being offered a full-time position in this role made the last two years of hard work feel extremely worthwhile.</p>

                <p>My apprenticeship also included 12 weeks of cyber security training courses, covering topics such as malware analysis, cyber operations and penetration testing. These courses broadened my knowledge of cyber security and helped me with my day-to-day responsibilities, especially with my time in the Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC).</p>

                <p>I've also had the opportunity to speak at events and run awaydays for other apprentices across similar government schemes.

                <p><span><span><span>We previously used our computer system to record exemptions and expiry dates, which had streamlined the checking process. Now, as we go through our normal dispensing procedure for EPS prescriptions, the dispensing terminal connects to <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/">the NHS Business Service Authority (NHSBSA)</a>.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>The exemption check happens in the background, without interfering with the dispensing. If the patient has a valid exemption, the system simply tells the team in the pharmacy. And a handy addition is that the supplier has tweaked the software so that ‘Exempt’ is automatically printed on the bag label.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>The new system works very effectively, and it does save time – both in the pharmacy and out on the road.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Our counter is often busy, but if a patient has an exemption confirmed by the system then we no longer need to capture their signature. Not having to attach the prescription to the bag with the medicine also helps. More importantly, time is saved at the counter because patients don’t need to look for their certificates, or even their glasses so they can read the back of the prescription.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Our counter staff say that Real Time Exemption Checking is helping them deal with patients quicker and is reducing queues. We used to have lots of conversations with exempt patients who were unsure over which box to tick, with staff explaining the consequences of an incorrect choice. These conversations don’t happen as much now.&nbsp; I have also noticed that patients are pleasantly surprised that they don’t have to sign for their exemption anymore.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Real Time Exemption Checking &nbsp;will also help reduce the number of patients who would be fined up to £100 for ticking the wrong exemption box. This was a major source of frustration with our patients.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>It helps out on the doorstep as well. It has reduced tension during deliveries, as some patients get annoyed about having to show their exemptions to drivers – “but I showed it last time”. One of our delivery drivers has told me that 40% of his deliveries no longer need the patient to sign as they have had the electronic exemption confirmed. </span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Real Time Exemption Checking also helps pharmacy staff at month-end as we do not have to send tokens&nbsp;to the NHSBSA if an exemption has been confirmed by the system – they are safely destroyed instead.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Overall, we are having to do a lot less ‘policing’ of the process thanks to Real Time Exemption Checking. It is freeing up time for our staff, as well as reducing potential for confusion and upset for our patients. Even if someone’s status is unknown rather than exempt, the system will flag this up and we will follow our normal dispensing process and have the patient complete a declaration. </span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Nobody is refused medicine because the system does not know that they are exempt. The patients really do benefit from Real Time Exemption Checking. Any pharmacy should be using it if they can.</span></span></span></p>

We receive prescriptions from 14 local GP practices, and we deliver to patients at home in Cleethorpes, Grimsby and the surrounding area.</span></span></span></strong></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Our pharmacy counter is also extremely busy, serving patients from the GP practice we share the building with and customers who call in. Many people we serve are exempt from paying for their prescriptions and need to provide evidence and a signature if this is the case. </span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>We are very enthusiastic about using any new advances in technology – we were one of the first community pharmacies to use <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service">the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)</a> – and we have a pharmacy robot as well as dispensing terminals. </span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Our pharmacy counter is also extremely busy, serving patients from the GP practice we share the building with and customers who call in.

                <p><span><span><span>We are very enthusiastic about using any new advances in technology – we were one of the first community pharmacies to use <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service">the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)</a> – and we have a pharmacy robot as well as dispensing terminals. </span></span></span></p>

So the chance to work with NHS Digital and <a href="https://www.positive-solutions.co.uk/real-time-exemption-checking/">system supplier Positive Solutions</a> to pilot the Real Time Exemption Checking was one that we jumped at.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>We previously used our computer system to record exemptions and expiry dates, which had streamlined the checking process. Now, as we go through our normal dispensing procedure for EPS prescriptions, the dispensing terminal connects to <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/">the NHS Business Service Authority (NHSBSA)</a>.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>The exemption check happens in the background, without interfering with the dispensing. If the patient has a valid exemption, the system simply tells the team in the pharmacy. And a handy addition is that the supplier has tweaked the software so that ‘Exempt’ is automatically printed on the bag label.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>The new system works very effectively, and it does save time – both in the pharmacy and out on the road.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Our counter is often busy, but if a patient has an exemption confirmed by the system then we no longer need to capture their signature. Not having to attach the prescription to the bag with the medicine also helps. More importantly, time is saved at the counter because patients don’t need to look for their certificates, or even their glasses so they can read the back of the prescription.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><iframe allowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LsRixksbARk" width="560" height="315"></iframe></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Our counter staff say that Real Time Exemption Checking is helping them deal with patients quicker and is reducing queues. We used to have lots of conversations with exempt patients who were unsure over which box to tick, with staff explaining the consequences of an incorrect choice. These conversations don’t happen as much now.&nbsp; I have also noticed that patients are pleasantly surprised that they don’t have to sign for their exemption anymore.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Real Time Exemption Checking &nbsp;will also help reduce the number of patients who would be fined up to £100 for ticking the wrong exemption box. This was a major source of frustration with our patients.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>It helps out on the doorstep as well. It has reduced tension during deliveries, as some patients get annoyed about having to show their exemptions to drivers – “but I showed it last time”. One of our delivery drivers has told me that 40% of his deliveries no longer need the patient to sign as they have had the electronic exemption confirmed. </span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Real Time Exemption Checking also helps pharmacy staff at month-end as we do not have to send tokens&nbsp;to the NHSBSA if an exemption has been confirmed by the system – they are safely destroyed instead.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Overall, we are having to do a lot less ‘policing’ of the process thanks to Real Time Exemption Checking. It is freeing up time for our staff, as well as reducing potential for confusion and upset for our patients. Even if someone’s status is unknown rather than exempt, the system will flag this up and we will follow our normal dispensing process and have the patient complete a declaration. </span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span>Nobody is refused medicine because the system does not know that they are exempt. The patients really do benefit from Real Time Exemption Checking. Any pharmacy should be using it if they can.</span></span></span></p>

                <p><strong>When I was made redundant in December 2017, I saw it as an opportunity to take stock of my life and think about what I wanted to do next.</strong></p>

                <p>I was working as a project manager for a charity, helping people whose lives were in crisis and facing severe destitution. Due to funding cuts, I found myself unemployed.</p>

                <p>My work at the charity had already got me interested in how the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in society faced even more social and financial inequality because of their inability to access digital technologies. In fact, I was so fascinated by it that I researched digital inequality for my master’s degree in anthropology.</p>

                <p>Serendipitously, I saw Sky was advertising a 'get into tech' day, so I went along and loved it! They taught us a bit of computer programming, told us about all the exciting things that were going on in the tech industry and, best of all, revealed that technical skills can be learned by anyone.</p>

                <p>I decided to learn how to code and I treated learning it like a full-time job. I spent hours and hours, determined I would get into tech as soon as possible. Less than eight months later, I got a place on NHS Digital's graduate scheme as a developer.</p>

                <p>It was a perfect fit for me because it meant I could continue my digital activism. That means constantly working to remind my colleagues of the existence of the digital divide and how this can impact healthcare. I've enjoyed being able to dip my toes into lots of different areas of the business and being surrounded by people who genuinely want to do 'tech for good', too.</p>

                <p>The graduate scheme was so flexible in terms of the projects I could work on that I managed to land my dream placement in the cyber security team. I work with a team of very talented and dedicated individuals in the Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) as an analyst. We spend our days ensuring that cyber attacks are defended against so that the frontline can keep delivering brilliant patient care unimpeded.</p>

                <p>My current focus is automating our existing processes so that we can free up resources and improve resilience against new and complex threats. When I’m not doing that, I’m monitoring the traffic that flows through NHS Digital’s network to see if there is anything unusual that could indicate a problem. It’s a job that can be simultaneously terrifying and exciting – and I couldn’t be happier.</p>

                <p>Outside of this, my proudest achievement has been my involvement in delivering the Women's Network-powered code club. It started as a one-off event but has now become a regular fixture on the learning and development calendar at NHS Digital. So far we've taught nearly 100 people the basics of HTML and CSS. The idea is to drive up digital literacy across the whole of NHS Digital's workforce&nbsp;so everybody understands what our developers do and can work collaboratively in our agile and cross-functional teams.</p>

                <p>Sessions have sold out and the feedback has been phenomenal. There has even been some discussion about extending the format across the civil service.</p>

                <p>Retraining for a career in tech is a sound investment, but it can mean a drop in salary and I appreciate that not everyone will be able to do this.</p>

                <p>There is also the crippling imposter syndrome that can hit out of the blue, particularly when I'm working on anything that requires me to use my technical skills. Being so new to the industry, I can worry that I'm not at the level I need to be.</p>

                <p>To get over that, I remind myself of all I have achieved in the last 20 months and of the fact that tech is always on the move. Complete mastery of a subject is a fairytale!</p>

                <p>This is the message I spread through my public speaking. When I was teaching myself how to code, I'd get stuck on problems with no one to ask for help. That was until I realised that there was such a fantastic tech-scene in Leeds. You can literally go to a different tech event every night, if you want to.</p>

                <p>At these events, I kept hearing people's stories of how they got into tech from non-technical backgrounds. It inspired me to keep going. My advice for anyone thinking about retraining – and especially to women in the run up to International Women’s Day: the time to get into tech is now! We can all do so much good with these tools and, with a bit of determination, you can get them too.</p>

                <p><strong>When I was made redundant in December 2017, I saw it as an opportunity to take stock of my life and think about what I wanted to do next.</strong></p>

                <p>I was working as a project manager for a charity, helping people whose lives were in crisis and facing severe destitution. Due to funding cuts, I found myself unemployed.</p>

                <p>My work at the charity had already got me interested in how the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in society faced even more social and financial inequality because of their inability to access digital technologies. In fact, I was so fascinated by it that I researched digital inequality for my master’s degree in anthropology.</p>

                <p>Serendipitously, I saw Sky was advertising a 'get into tech' day, so I went along and loved it! They taught us a bit of computer programming, told us about all the exciting things that were going on in the tech industry and, best of all, revealed that technical skills can be learned by anyone.</p>

                <p>I decided to learn how to code and I treated learning it like a full-time job. I spent hours and hours, determined I would get into tech as soon as possible. Less than eight months later, I got a place on NHS Digital's graduate scheme as a developer.</p>

                <p>It was a perfect fit for me because it meant I could continue my digital activism. That means constantly working to remind my colleagues of the existence of the digital divide and how this can impact healthcare. I've enjoyed being able to dip my toes into lots of different areas of the business and being surrounded by people who genuinely want to do 'tech for good', too.</p>

                <p>The graduate scheme was so flexible in terms of the projects I could work on that I managed to land my dream placement in the cyber security team. I work with a team of very talented and dedicated individuals in the Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) as an analyst. We spend our days ensuring that cyber attacks are defended against so that the frontline can keep delivering brilliant patient care unimpeded.</p>

                <p>My current focus is automating our existing processes so that we can free up resources and improve resilience against new and complex threats. When I’m not doing that, I’m monitoring the traffic that flows through NHS Digital’s network to see if there is anything unusual that could indicate a problem. It’s a job that can be simultaneously terrifying and exciting – and I couldn’t be happier.</p>

                <p>Outside of this, my proudest achievement has been my involvement in delivering the Women's Network-powered code club. It started as a one-off event but has now become a regular fixture on the learning and development calendar at NHS Digital. So far we've taught nearly 100 people the basics of HTML and CSS. The idea is to drive up digital literacy across the whole of NHS Digital's workforce&nbsp;so everybody understands what our developers do and can work collaboratively in our agile and cross-functional teams.</p>

                <p>Sessions have sold out and the feedback has been phenomenal. There has even been some discussion about extending the format across the civil service.</p>

                <p>But don’t let me give the impression that it has always been easy.</p>

                <p>Retraining for a career in tech is a sound investment, but it can mean a drop in salary and I appreciate that not everyone will be able to do this.</p>

                <p>There is also the crippling imposter syndrome that can hit out of the blue, particularly when I'm working on anything that requires me to use my technical skills. Being so new to the industry, I can worry that I'm not at the level I need to be.</p>

I work with a team of very talented and dedicated individuals in the Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) as an analyst. We spend our days ensuring that cyber attacks are defended against so that the frontline can keep delivering brilliant patient care unimpeded.</p>

                <p>My current focus is automating our existing processes so that we can free up resources and improve resilience against new and complex threats. When I’m not doing that, I’m monitoring the traffic that flows through NHS Digital’s network to see if there is anything unusual that could indicate a problem. It’s a job that can be simultaneously terrifying and exciting – and I couldn’t be happier.</p>

                <p>Outside of this, my proudest achievement has been my involvement in delivering the Women's Network-powered code club. It started as a one-off event but has now become a regular fixture on the learning and development calendar at NHS Digital. So far we've taught nearly 100 people the basics of HTML and CSS. The idea is to drive up digital literacy across the whole of NHS Digital's workforce&nbsp;so everybody understands what our developers do and can work collaboratively in our agile and cross-functional teams.</p>

                <p>Sessions have sold out and the feedback has been phenomenal. There has even been some discussion about extending the format across the civil service.</p>

                <p>But don’t let me give the impression that it has always been easy.</p>

                <p>Retraining for a career in tech is a sound investment, but it can mean a drop in salary and I appreciate that not everyone will be able to do this.</p>

                <p>There is also the crippling imposter syndrome that can hit out of the blue, particularly when I'm working on anything that requires me to use my technical skills. Being so new to the industry, I can worry that I'm not at the level I need to be.</p>

                <p>To get over that, I remind myself of all I have achieved in the last 20 months and of the fact that tech is always on the move. Complete mastery of a subject is a fairytale!</p>

                <p>This is the message I spread through my public speaking. When I was teaching myself how to code, I'd get stuck on problems with no one to ask for help. That was until I realised that there was such a fantastic tech-scene in Leeds. You can literally go to a different tech event every night, if you want to.</p>

                <p>At these events, I kept hearing people's stories of how they got into tech from non-technical backgrounds. It inspired me to keep going. My advice for anyone thinking about retraining – and especially to women in the run up to International Women’s Day: the time to get into tech is now! We can all do so much good with these tools and, with a bit of determination, you can get them too.</p>

                <p>I’ve recently had a number of conversations with people working on extremely important services. It’s easy for the pressure to build, with the fear that a mistake you make now might have a butterfly effect on people’s lives. It’s hard to avoid the feeling that you’re not cut out for such momentous decision-making. You’re just a designer or a developer, a product manager, or whatever. It’s probably not what most of us expected to be doing when we chose (or fell into) this game.</p>

                <p>So here are just a few tips that I will be bearing in mind over the coming weeks and months.<br />

                with the usability or accessibility of a project. You may be digitally
                literate, with an up-to-date phone and good broadband, but many people
                aren’t. Some people who would normally access services in person,
                may now be turning to digital methods for the first time, if they
                cannot leave their homes. You need to understand the different ways
                people access digital content and services – what technology they
                use, and how confident they are. Don’t take chances with anything
                ‘new’ – rely on the accessible, researched components and patterns
                others have already made.</p>

                <p>Don’t make assumptions about the devices your users will be using. Might your thing be used by healthcare staff? If so, they’re probably all on desktop machines, so you don’t need to design mobile-first, right? You might even have some stats about that.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Even then, you can’t make guesses about screen resolutions or how staff need to use the service in their day-to-day. My colleague Matt Nixon recently told me he’s observed healthcare staff often having two screens open at once (on half-width), as they need information from two different systems. Some staff might have poor eyesight and need to increase the font size. Making your thing responsive covers you for things you might have never even considered.</p>

                <p>As I mentioned earlier, the coronavirus situation is unprecedented. We have not had to respond in this way before, and that brings a weight with it. But you can’t let that eat you up or you will become paralysed. If you are following good practice, if you are sharing your work and thinking with the right people (colleagues, policy people, clinicians), and you are doing user research, then you are doing your job properly.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The stakes may feel higher, but you are still using user centered design to affect a desired outcome. Whether that’s presenting information to healthcare staff to help them make decisions or guiding poorly people to the right type of care and advice, these things should not be scary - if you are following good practice.</p>

                <p>I mentioned this in <a href="https://twitter.com/DeanVipond/status/1241420438007353344">a Twitter thread</a> recently about how weird everything is now. We’re all terrified of a whole host of different things outside of work right now, but the potential life-or-death implications of our design work should not be one of those.</p>

                <p>But if you are finding it scary and if it is weighing you down, talk to someone! Now is not the time to bury things and hope the fear goes away. Send me a DM on Twitter @DeanVipond if you’re having a tough time and working on some challenging stuff. I’ll help as best I can.</p>

                <p>I’ve recently had a number of conversations with people working on extremely important services. It’s easy for the pressure to build, with the fear that a mistake you make now might have a butterfly effect on people’s lives. It’s hard to avoid the feeling that you’re not cut out for such momentous decision-making. You’re just a designer or a developer, a product manager, or whatever. It’s probably not what most of us expected to be doing when we chose (or fell into) this game.</p>

                <p>So here are just a few tips that I will be bearing in mind over the coming weeks and months.<br />

              hippostd:content: <p>Working at speed is no excuse for cutting corners
                with the usability or accessibility of a project. You may be digitally
                literate, with an up-to-date phone and good broadband, but many people
                aren’t. Some people who would normally access services in person,
                may now be turning to digital methods for the first time, if they
                cannot leave their homes. You need to understand the different ways
                people access digital content and services – what technology they
                use, and how confident they are. Don’t take chances with anything
                ‘new’ – rely on the accessible, researched components and patterns
                others have already made.</p>

                intent of a project. You can still take the steps to ensure your decision-making
                is informed by research, and I recommend reading service design expert

                <p>Even then, you can’t make guesses about screen resolutions or how staff need to use the service in their day-to-day. My colleague Matt Nixon recently told me he’s observed healthcare staff often having two screens open at once (on half-width), as they need information from two different systems. Some staff might have poor eyesight and need to increase the font size. Making your thing responsive covers you for things you might have never even considered.</p>

But you can’t let that eat you up or you will become paralysed. If you are following good practice, if you are sharing your work and thinking with the right people (colleagues, policy people, clinicians), and you are doing user research, then you are doing your job properly.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The stakes may feel higher, but you are still using user centered design to affect a desired outcome. Whether that’s presenting information to healthcare staff to help them make decisions or guiding poorly people to the right type of care and advice, these things should not be scary - if you are following good practice.</p>

                <p>I mentioned this in <a href="https://twitter.com/DeanVipond/status/1241420438007353344">a Twitter thread</a> recently about how weird everything is now. We’re all terrified of a whole host of different things outside of work right now, but the potential life-or-death implications of our design work should not be one of those.</p>

                <p>But if you are finding it scary and if it is weighing you down, talk to someone! Now is not the time to bury things and hope the fear goes away. Send me a DM on Twitter @DeanVipond if you’re having a tough time and working on some challenging stuff. I’ll help as best I can.</p>

                <p><strong>The coronavirus pandemic has led to huge increases in the use of public-facing digital health services in the UK.</strong></p>

                <p>The NHS App, which has proved itself to be a valuable tool for patients managing their care from home, now has over 1 million users – more than double the number at the start of March.</p>

                <p>Every transaction enabled through the NHS App, from self-triage to ordering repeat medications to letting someone see <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/news-and-events/news/coronavirus-test-results-now-visible-to-gps">a test result</a>, is saving time for both the patient and the healthcare professional. It also prevents a piece of paper being printed and moved hand-to-hand through the system.</p>

                <p>We know from research that there is much more we could do, to make the NHS App more useful to people, and we have been working hard on some new features.</p>

                deliver, helping to reduce unnecessary travel. There have been over

                <p>We have also made it possible to interact with your GP on behalf of a child or relative. We call this proxy access. By asking your GP to link your profiles in their clinical system, you can switch between profiles in the NHS App to do things like ordering your child’s repeat prescriptions or seeing your parent’s current medications. All of which is saving patients phone calls or trips to the doctor.</p>

                <p>Currently, acting as a proxy only works if you are in the same practice as the person your profile is linked to, but we are working on this being available across other practices too.</p>

                <p>Some of the interesting design challenges the team had to overcome was understanding the language people use to understand what “proxy” means. We settled on “linked profiles” after research and testing. The team also had to make sure the user understood when they were doing something for themselves versus doing something for someone else by having a clear division of “switching” profiles prompts at the end of each journey, and including a banner and other visual clues in proxy mode.</p>

                <p>We have introduced the concept of a messaging ‘hub’ in the NHS App where different types of messages may appear. One of the essential parts of good healthcare is communication between a patient and their practice, so we have been doing lots of work to allow people to do this in the app.</p>

                <p>We’ve currently enabled patient-to-practice messaging in two of the GP IT systems in use across England, EMIS and TPP, so where this&nbsp;is switched on by a practice, it’s possible to send messages to your GP from within the app.</p>

                <p>The real power of this messaging feature will come once our integrated partners are able to use it as a platform to communicate with patients. By allowing parties such as eConsult or Patients Know Best, access to the functionality, it can be used for reminders for referral appointments&nbsp;and online consultations&nbsp; -&nbsp; removing yet more paper and wasted time from the system. This work is under way and we expect it to be available later this year.</p>

                <p>The NHS App and NHS login programmes are working collaboratively to look at new and alternative ways we can make registration and proving identity easier, so that all users can make use of the full capabilities of the NHS App and its <a href="update-on-features-of-the-nhs-app">new features</a>.</p>

                <p>In June, we made a change which enabled users to access the NHS App without having to do everything needed for a full ID-verified (IDV) journey, but instead could access the app's information and advice with a simpler NHS number trace. Just over half a million users have now accessed the NHS App this way.</p>

                <p>Simplified registration and easier ways of proving identity are key deliveries in our&nbsp;roadmap.</p>

                <p>Finally, a word on our approach for the future. In June, Tracy Higgs <a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2020/launching-online-consultations-in-the-nhs-app-during-covid-19" target="_blank">blogged</a> about online consultations in the NHS App. This work is part of NHSX’s wider agenda for the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/31/the-nhs-app-a-platform-for-innovation/">NHS App to be a platform</a> that enables users access to a series of nationally available services like 111 online, and also provides access to digital services that may be individual to a particular trust or practice at a local level.</p>

                <p>We published some information about this approach in February&nbsp;&nbsp;and engaged with the supplier community that the information is targeted at, just before COVID-19 hit. I’m happy to say we’re picking this up again, so if you commission or supply digital health and care services, please take a look at <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-app/nhs-app-strategy">our strategy</a>, and tell us what you think about our approach and priorities using our <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=Hwf2UP67GkCIA2c3SOYp4kwj6ZLMKR1BkoP5IXESqVJUMkRSTDJRMlE1Qlk0MEpLVjFJR0FYOEdYQy4u">short survey</a></p>

                <p>We have introduced the concept of a messaging ‘hub’ in the NHS App where different types of messages may appear. One of the essential parts of good healthcare is communication between a patient and their practice, so we have been doing lots of work to allow people to do this in the app.</p>

                <p>We’ve currently enabled patient-to-practice messaging in two of the GP IT systems in use across England, EMIS and TPP, so where this&nbsp;is switched on by a practice, it’s possible to send messages to your GP from within the app.</p>

                <p>The real power of this messaging feature will come once our integrated partners are able to use it as a platform to communicate with patients. By allowing parties such as eConsult or Patients Know Best, access to the functionality, it can be used for reminders for referral appointments&nbsp;and online consultations&nbsp; -&nbsp; removing yet more paper and wasted time from the system. This work is under way and we expect it to be available later this year.</p>

                <p>The NHS App and NHS login programmes are working collaboratively to look at new and alternative ways we can make registration and proving identity easier, so that all users can make use of the full capabilities of the NHS App and its <a href="update-on-features-of-the-nhs-app">new features</a>.</p>

                <p>In June, we made a change which enabled users to access the NHS App without having to do everything needed for a full ID-verified (IDV) journey, but instead could access the app's information and advice with a simpler NHS number trace. Just over half a million users have now accessed the NHS App this way.</p>

                <p>Simplified registration and easier ways of proving identity are key deliveries in our&nbsp;roadmap.</p>

                <p>Finally, a word on our approach for the future. In June, Tracy Higgs <a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2020/launching-online-consultations-in-the-nhs-app-during-covid-19" target="_blank">blogged</a> about online consultations in the NHS App. This work is part of NHSX’s wider agenda for the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/31/the-nhs-app-a-platform-for-innovation/">NHS App to be a platform</a> that enables users access to a series of nationally available services like 111 online, and also provides access to digital services that may be individual to a particular trust or practice at a local level.</p>

                <p>We published some information about this approach in February&nbsp;&nbsp;and engaged with the supplier community that the information is targeted at, just before COVID-19 hit. I’m happy to say we’re picking this up again, so if you commission or supply digital health and care services, please take a look at <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-app/nhs-app-strategy">our strategy</a>, and tell us what you think about our approach and priorities using our <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=Hwf2UP67GkCIA2c3SOYp4kwj6ZLMKR1BkoP5IXESqVJUMkRSTDJRMlE1Qlk0MEpLVjFJR0FYOEdYQy4u">short survey</a></p>

                <p>We have introduced the concept of a messaging ‘hub’ in the NHS App where different types of messages may appear. One of the essential parts of good healthcare is communication between a patient and their practice, so we have been doing lots of work to allow people to do this in the app.</p>

                <p>We’ve currently enabled patient-to-practice messaging in two of the GP IT systems in use across England, EMIS and TPP, so where this&nbsp;is switched on by a practice, it’s possible to send messages to your GP from within the app.</p>

                <p>The real power of this messaging feature will come once our integrated partners are able to use it as a platform to communicate with patients. By allowing parties such as eConsult or Patients Know Best, access to the functionality, it can be used for reminders for referral appointments&nbsp;and online consultations&nbsp; -&nbsp; removing yet more paper and wasted time from the system. This work is under way and we expect it to be available later this year.</p>

                <p>The NHS App and NHS login programmes are working collaboratively to look at new and alternative ways we can make registration and proving identity easier, so that all users can make use of the full capabilities of the NHS App and its <a href="update-on-features-of-the-nhs-app">new features</a>.</p>

                <p>In June, we made a change which enabled users to access the NHS App without having to do everything needed for a full ID-verified (IDV) journey, but instead could access the app's information and advice with a simpler NHS number trace. Just over half a million users have now accessed the NHS App this way.</p>

                <p>Simplified registration and easier ways of proving identity are key deliveries in our&nbsp;roadmap.</p>

In June, Tracy Higgs <a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2020/launching-online-consultations-in-the-nhs-app-during-covid-19" target="_blank">blogged</a> about online consultations in the NHS App. This work is part of NHSX’s wider agenda for the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/31/the-nhs-app-a-platform-for-innovation/">NHS App to be a platform</a> that enables users access to a series of nationally available services like 111 online, and also provides access to digital services that may be individual to a particular trust or practice at a local level.</p>

                <p>We published some information about this approach in February&nbsp;&nbsp;and engaged with the supplier community that the information is targeted at, just before COVID-19 hit. I’m happy to say we’re picking this up again, so if you commission or supply digital health and care services, please take a look at <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-app/nhs-app-strategy">our strategy</a>, and tell us what you think about our approach and priorities using our <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=Hwf2UP67GkCIA2c3SOYp4kwj6ZLMKR1BkoP5IXESqVJUMkRSTDJRMlE1Qlk0MEpLVjFJR0FYOEdYQy4u">short survey</a></p>

                <p><strong>Countless innovators both inside the NHS and in the healthtech sector have been working hard to develop new mobile products and digital health technologies that can help in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Lauren Harkins, the digital assessment programme lead, Rhod Joyce, head of partnerships, and Indra Joshi, Director of AI at NHSX, explain how we are making sure that these products can get to market quickly but safely.&nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p>NHSX is working with NHS Digital to fast-track and evaluate apps (and similar technologies) that support our response to COVID-19, using the existing Digital Assessment Questionnaire (DAQ) within the Digital Assessment Portal (DAP). We are using this established process for products and services in high priority areas. These are products that will help citizens at home, the NHS and social care workforce, or those providing data to the NHS.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>At this critical time, in which products are being built and scaled at pace, it is as important as ever to undertake these assessments to ensure they are safe to use. So we are currently fast-tracking assessments with these existing standards to ensure that we can get these offerings out to those who need them. We are also providing additional support to developers through the process. The areas of focus are: clinical safety; data protection; and security.</p>

                <p>We have paused assessments for apps that are not directly related to the COVID-19 response, so we can focus on the ones that most need quick approval. We will resume assessing the rest - from where they left off in the process - as soon as we are able.<br />

                <p>The assessment process reviews the safety and security of apps and checks that an app does what it says it does. The process and timescale differs depending on the product because the questions we ask change according to the complexity and risk profile of the product or service being assessed. Apps that are not processing patient data, for example, are asked fewer questions than those products that do. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>When we talk to digital health innovators, we say that the key to getting through the assessment quickly is answering the questions as accurately as possible and providing the evidence to support this. Our objective is working collaboratively so, if a company hasn’t documented something whilst scaling at pace, we can look at what they have got and continue with other areas of the assessment.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We have been steadfastly committed to provide assurance to ensure that digital health technologies demonstrate levels of safety and efficacy appropriate for use in much the same way we would for traditional support or treatments, and for citizens and health and care staff to have access to the best digital tools.</p>

                <p>In the coming weeks we will review the outcomes of this consultation and plan to transition to this Digital Health Technology Standard as the core assessment process going forwards. We will follow up with further details shortly.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Countless innovators both inside the NHS and in the healthtech sector have been working hard to develop new mobile products and digital health technologies that can help in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Lauren Harkins, the digital assessment programme lead, Rhod Joyce, head of partnerships, and Indra Joshi, Director of AI at NHSX, explain how we are making sure that these products can get to market quickly but safely.&nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p>NHSX is working with NHS Digital to fast-track and evaluate apps (and similar technologies) that support our response to COVID-19, using the existing Digital Assessment Questionnaire (DAQ) within the Digital Assessment Portal (DAP). We are using this established process for products and services in high priority areas. These are products that will help citizens at home, the NHS and social care workforce, or those providing data to the NHS.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>At this critical time, in which products are being built and scaled at pace, it is as important as ever to undertake these assessments to ensure they are safe to use. So we are currently fast-tracking assessments with these existing standards to ensure that we can get these offerings out to those who need them. We are also providing additional support to developers through the process. The areas of focus are: clinical safety; data protection; and security.</p>

                <p>We have paused assessments for apps that are not directly related to the COVID-19 response, so we can focus on the ones that most need quick approval. We will resume assessing the rest - from where they left off in the process - as soon as we are able.<br />

                <p>The assessment process reviews the safety and security of apps and checks that an app does what it says it does. The process and timescale differs depending on the product because the questions we ask change according to the complexity and risk profile of the product or service being assessed. Apps that are not processing patient data, for example, are asked fewer questions than those products that do. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>When we talk to digital health innovators, we say that the key to getting through the assessment quickly is answering the questions as accurately as possible and providing the evidence to support this. Our objective is working collaboratively so, if a company hasn’t documented something whilst scaling at pace, we can look at what they have got and continue with other areas of the assessment.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Completing the assessment allows a company to state that their product or service has been assessed to the NHS standards, and that it has met those standards in any communications or press notices released. However, it does not allow the developer to state that the product or service has been ‘endorsed’ or ‘approved’ for use by the NHS.</p>

                <p>A description would be: “<em>product xxx has been assessed and has met the standards required by the NHS</em>”.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>For apps that are also providing data back to the NHS as part of our COVID-19 efforts, the description would continue: “...and is supporting the NHS and the Government to manage the COVID-19 crisis”.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Looking back to February this year, we launched <a href="https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/27/have-your-say-on-our-standard-for-digital-health-technologies/">an open consultation on the proposed Digital Health Technology Standards</a> that we felt encompassed efficacy, safety, security, robustness, stability, interoperability, usability, accessibility and responsibility and provided a clear process for reviewing, assessing and evaluating digital health technologies. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>We have been steadfastly committed to provide assurance to ensure that digital health technologies demonstrate levels of safety and efficacy appropriate for use in much the same way we would for traditional support or treatments, and for citizens and health and care staff to have access to the best digital tools.</p>

                <p>In the coming weeks we will review the outcomes of this consultation and plan to transition to this Digital Health Technology Standard as the core assessment process going forwards. We will follow up with further details shortly.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We have been steadfastly committed to provide assurance to ensure that digital health technologies demonstrate levels of safety and efficacy appropriate for use in much the same way we would for traditional support or treatments, and for citizens and health and care staff to have access to the best digital tools.</p>

                <p>In the coming weeks we will review the outcomes of this consultation and plan to transition to this Digital Health Technology Standard as the core assessment process going forwards. We will follow up with further details shortly.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Around the world, researchers are racing to find an effective treatment for coronavirus (COVID-19). A range of potential treatments have been suggested, including convalescent plasma therapy. </strong></p>

                <p>Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood taken from people who have recovered from COVID-19, which may contain antibodies that prevent the coronavirus from entering and infecting cells in the body.</p>

                <p>There’s evidence to suggest that transfusing COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma could improve their recovery time and increase their chance of survival. NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) are involved in two clinical trials – <a href="https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/covid-19-research/research-and-trials/plasma-trials/">REMAP-CAP&nbsp;and&nbsp;RECOVERY</a> – to establish if treatment with convalescent plasma does benefit patients and if so, at what point in their illness they should be treated.</p>

                <p>NHSBT already collects plasma from donors in the form of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which is routinely given to patients after a major haemorrhage or trauma. Convalescent plasma is the same blood component as FFP and is manufactured to the same <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency">Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency</a> (MHRA) regulations – the only difference is that the donor is known to have recovered from COVID-19.</p>

                <p>Because doctors can already prescribe the use of any blood component NHSBT manufactures, convalescent plasma can be used by patients without additional research and development or ethics approval. However, it’s important that it’s used in the context of a clinical trial, otherwise it won’t be possible to determine if there are any benefits to COVID-19 patients compared to the normal course of treatment, and to identify which patients it will benefit the most.</p>

                <p>So, there’s already infrastructure in place to collect and process convalescent plasma, it’s safe to transfuse, and there’s clinical trials set up to test this treatment. What’s needed now are the donors.</p>

                <p>Thousands of convalescent plasma donations are needed from people who have recovered from COVID-19 for the REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY clinical trials, and to establish a continuing supply for treatment.</p>

                <p>NHSBT needs a larger pool of donors than those they currently have registered in their systems, so they asked for our help identifying people who fit the criteria to donate so they could contact them directly.</p>

                <p>We had to carefully consider what was the right thing to do, knowing not everyone would want their data used in this way but also recognising the potentially enormous benefit this treatment could bring to COVID-19 patients. We worked closely with our Information Governance team and our Caldicott Guardian and decided to share the data with NHSBT, as we were allowed to do so under emergency legislation during the pandemic.</p>

                <p>We’re doing this by linking demographic data we hold with COVID-19 test data, hospital admissions and intensive care data to identify thousands of patients that have recovered from COVID-19 who may be suitable donors. We’re making sure to remove details of anyone who has opted-out of sharing their data and others who would not be able to donate, for example those who are shielding.</p>

                <p>We’re sharing this linked dataset with NHSBT, who are using it to contact potential donors directly. We send them updated data weekly and have identified over 112,000 potential donors so far. &nbsp;As a result, 180 patients have been randomised in the convalescent plasma segments of the RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP clinical trials, and we are proud to be playing a small part in contributing towards finding an effective treatment for patients who are severely ill with COVID-19. Its been a great team effort to make this happen.</p>

                <p>At NHS Digital we have recognised the value of routinely collected NHS data to support clinical trials such as these.&nbsp;We are working in partnership with the University of Oxford Big Data Institute, IBM and Microsoft to create the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-digitrials">NHS DigiTrials</a> health data research hub to develop a range of data services specifically for clinical trials.</p>

                <p><strong>Around the world, researchers are racing to find an effective treatment for coronavirus (COVID-19). A range of potential treatments have been suggested, including convalescent plasma therapy. </strong></p>

                <p>Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood taken from people who have recovered from COVID-19, which may contain antibodies that prevent the coronavirus from entering and infecting cells in the body.</p>

                <p>There’s evidence to suggest that transfusing COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma could improve their recovery time and increase their chance of survival. NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) are involved in two clinical trials – <a href="https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/covid-19-research/research-and-trials/plasma-trials/">REMAP-CAP&nbsp;and&nbsp;RECOVERY</a> – to establish if treatment with convalescent plasma does benefit patients and if so, at what point in their illness they should be treated.</p>

                <p>NHSBT already collects plasma from donors in the form of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which is routinely given to patients after a major haemorrhage or trauma. Convalescent plasma is the same blood component as FFP and is manufactured to the same <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency">Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency</a> (MHRA) regulations – the only difference is that the donor is known to have recovered from COVID-19.</p>

                <p>Because doctors can already prescribe the use of any blood component NHSBT manufactures, convalescent plasma can be used by patients without additional research and development or ethics approval. However, it’s important that it’s used in the context of a clinical trial, otherwise it won’t be possible to determine if there are any benefits to COVID-19 patients compared to the normal course of treatment, and to identify which patients it will benefit the most.</p>

                <p>So, there’s already infrastructure in place to collect and process convalescent plasma, it’s safe to transfuse, and there’s clinical trials set up to test this treatment. What’s needed now are the donors.</p>

                <p>Thousands of convalescent plasma donations are needed from people who have recovered from COVID-19 for the REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY clinical trials, and to establish a continuing supply for treatment.</p>

                <p>NHSBT needs a larger pool of donors than those they currently have registered in their systems, so they asked for our help identifying people who fit the criteria to donate so they could contact them directly.</p>

                <p>We had to carefully consider what was the right thing to do, knowing not everyone would want their data used in this way but also recognising the potentially enormous benefit this treatment could bring to COVID-19 patients. We worked closely with our Information Governance team and our Caldicott Guardian and decided to share the data with NHSBT, as we were allowed to do so under emergency legislation during the pandemic.</p>

                <p>We’re doing this by linking demographic data we hold with COVID-19 test data, hospital admissions and intensive care data to identify thousands of patients that have recovered from COVID-19 who may be suitable donors. We’re making sure to remove details of anyone who has opted-out of sharing their data and others who would not be able to donate, for example those who are shielding.</p>

                <p>We’re sharing this linked dataset with NHSBT, who are using it to contact potential donors directly. We send them updated data weekly and have identified over 112,000 potential donors so far. &nbsp;As a result, 180 patients have been randomised in the convalescent plasma segments of the RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP clinical trials, and we are proud to be playing a small part in contributing towards finding an effective treatment for patients who are severely ill with COVID-19. Its been a great team effort to make this happen.</p>

                <p>At NHS Digital we have recognised the value of routinely collected NHS data to support clinical trials such as these.&nbsp;We are working in partnership with the University of Oxford Big Data Institute, IBM and Microsoft to create the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-digitrials">NHS DigiTrials</a> health data research hub to develop a range of data services specifically for clinical trials.</p>

                <p>So, there’s already infrastructure in place to collect and process convalescent plasma, it’s safe to transfuse, and there’s clinical trials set up to test this treatment. What’s needed now are the donors.</p>

                <p>Thousands of convalescent plasma donations are needed from people who have recovered from COVID-19 for the REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY clinical trials, and to establish a continuing supply for treatment.</p>

                <p>NHSBT needs a larger pool of donors than those they currently have registered in their systems, so they asked for our help identifying people who fit the criteria to donate so they could contact them directly.</p>

                <p>We’re doing this by linking demographic data we hold with COVID-19 test data, hospital admissions and intensive care data to identify thousands of patients that have recovered from COVID-19 who may be suitable donors. We’re making sure to remove details of anyone who has opted-out of sharing their data and others who would not be able to donate, for example those who are shielding.</p>

                <p>We’re sharing this linked dataset with NHSBT, who are using it to contact potential donors directly. We send them updated data weekly and have identified over 112,000 potential donors so far. &nbsp;As a result, 180 patients have been randomised in the convalescent plasma segments of the RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP clinical trials, and we are proud to be playing a small part in contributing towards finding an effective treatment for patients who are severely ill with COVID-19. Its been a great team effort to make this happen.</p>

                <p>At NHS Digital we have recognised the value of routinely collected NHS data to support clinical trials such as these.&nbsp;We are working in partnership with the University of Oxford Big Data Institute, IBM and Microsoft to create the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-digitrials">NHS DigiTrials</a> health data research hub to develop a range of data services specifically for clinical trials.</p>

                <p><strong>If your home internet service provider was charging you about 70% more for far less functionality than its competitors, would you switch?&nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p>About 40% of the NHS is still operating on the same legacy network (BT N3) procured by the system more than a decade ago. The logic for moving immediately to its replacement, the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network"><strong>Health and Social Care Network</strong></a> (HSCN), is at least as clear as the hypothetical domestic no-brainer above.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The NHS would be saving about £75 million a year for like-for-like services if everybody was on HSCN now. That’s about half the annual cost of a district general hospital.</p>

                <p>On the new network, organisations get access to a competitive market of 20 innovative suppliers. They get better <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network/new-to-hscn/improving-cyber-security">cyber security</a>, opportunities&nbsp;for interoperability with social care, and connections capable of supporting modern public cloud-based services. They also get faster and more reliable services, with 65% opting to buy fibre-based products.</p>

                <p>We will complete the full migration by August 2020. But I&nbsp;want to use this post to address one line of thought that may get in the way of that goal.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Let’s be clear: HSCN is a halfway house. &nbsp;All digital technologies are halfway houses – we are always part way to a more perfect future – but the successor to HSCN is in full view and is rapidly being built: '<strong>internet first'.</strong></p>

                <p>N3 was a huge private network for the NHS. Internet traffic went through its internet gateway, which was never big enough to meet the system’s demands. HSCN is a hybrid public-private network that gives direct access to the internet. The final destination is internet first – putting everything on the public network, standardising services, unlocking competition and creativity, and handling all security at the application level, where it needs to be.</p>

                <p>So, if HSCN is a halfway house, why should organisations not just go straight to 'internet first'? Why go to the bother of stopping over, when you could just push on to the final destination? &nbsp;</p>

                <p>The simple answer is that we need HSCN to give us time to allow us to get critical applications on the NHS core infrastructure ready for 'internet first'. Some are nearly there – NHSmail and the e-Referrals Service (e-RS)&nbsp;– but several dozen key applications must be reengineered or replaced. Some are delivered by NHS Digital, many are delivered by the diverse and innovative supplier market. The NHS Digital Internet First team are working hard at making that happen, but it’ll take a few years, and the £75m cost savings are&nbsp;available now.</p>

                <p>In the meantime, HSCN is the perfect segue to the Internet. If a user with an HSCN connection Googles something, the connection goes straight out through the HSCN security layer and onto the internet. &nbsp;If you want to use an application that isn’t ready for the internet, the HSCN connection automatically kicks in. It is able to determine, at the router level, whether the traffic can go straight out to the internet or needs to be routed through the private fork in the network.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This allows suppliers and organisations including NHS Digital to move at pace to public cloud-based services, but preserves the integrity of the NHS IT infrastructure and ensures we can offer full access to the services health and care organisations need now.</p>

                <p>And it is extremely good value for money. &nbsp;HSCN connections have ended up cheaper than the market rates for normal internet connections, just because the NHS has been buying in bulk in a highly competitive (and deflationary) market. Plus, as it’s less expensive, most sites are going for a significant capacity upgrade.</p>

                <p><strong>If your home internet service provider was charging you about 70% more for far less functionality than its competitors, would you switch?&nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p>About 40% of the NHS is still operating on the same legacy network (BT N3) procured by the system more than a decade ago. The logic for moving immediately to its replacement, the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network"><strong>Health and Social Care Network</strong></a> (HSCN), is at least as clear as the hypothetical domestic no-brainer above.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The NHS would be saving about £75 million a year for like-for-like services if everybody was on HSCN now. That’s about half the annual cost of a district general hospital.</p>

                <p>On the new network, organisations get access to a competitive market of 20 innovative suppliers.

                <p>We will complete the full migration by August 2020. But I&nbsp;want to use this post to address one line of thought that may get in the way of that goal.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Let’s be clear: HSCN is a halfway house. &nbsp;All digital technologies are halfway houses – we are always part way to a more perfect future – but the successor to HSCN is in full view and is rapidly being built: '<strong>internet first'.</strong></p>

                <p>N3 was a huge private network for the NHS. Internet traffic went through its internet gateway, which was never big enough to meet the system’s demands. HSCN is a hybrid public-private network that gives direct access to the internet. The final destination is internet first – putting everything on the public network, standardising services, unlocking competition and creativity, and handling all security at the application level, where it needs to be.</p>

                <p>So, if HSCN is a halfway house, why should organisations not just go straight to 'internet first'? Why go to the bother of stopping over, when you could just push on to the final destination? &nbsp;</p>

                <p>The simple answer is that we need HSCN to give us time to allow us to get critical applications on the NHS core infrastructure ready for 'internet first'. Some are nearly there – NHSmail and the e-Referrals Service (e-RS)&nbsp;– but several dozen key applications must be reengineered or replaced. Some are delivered by NHS Digital, many are delivered by the diverse and innovative supplier market. The NHS Digital Internet First team are working hard at making that happen, but it’ll take a few years, and the £75m cost savings are&nbsp;available now.</p>

                <p>In the meantime, HSCN is the perfect segue to the Internet. If a user with an HSCN connection Googles something, the connection goes straight out through the HSCN security layer and onto the internet. &nbsp;If you want to use an application that isn’t ready for the internet, the HSCN connection automatically kicks in. It is able to determine, at the router level, whether the traffic can go straight out to the internet or needs to be routed through the private fork in the network.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This allows suppliers and organisations including NHS Digital to move at pace to public cloud-based services, but preserves the integrity of the NHS IT infrastructure and ensures we can offer full access to the services health and care organisations need now.</p>

                <p>And it is extremely good value for money. &nbsp;HSCN connections have ended up cheaper than the market rates for normal internet connections, just because the NHS has been buying in bulk in a highly competitive (and deflationary) market. Plus, as it’s less expensive, most sites are going for a significant capacity upgrade.</p>

                <p><strong>At the start of the coronavirus crisis in March, GP practices faced a major challenge in dealing with its poorly patients.

                <p>As the crisis developed, people were making calls to NHS 111 and then being referred to pharmacies as part of the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/primary-care/pharmacy/community-pharmacist-consultation-service/">Community Pharmacist Consultation Service</a> to get urgent medication. This initiative proved invaluable at a time when community pharmacies became the only primary care service to be operating largely business as usual.</p>

                <p>However, it was more important than ever for GPs to be kept up-to-date on what medication their patients were receiving so the GPs didn’t re-supply the drugs unnecessarily. &nbsp;GPs had been used to receiving these notifications from pharmacies by either NHSmail, fax or paper. This was an inefficient way of sharing information and meant practice staff had to manually update patients’ records – this took valuable time and was prone to transcribing errors.</p>

                <p>The task acts as a prompt for the GP to review the information and add a note to the patient’s record where necessary without having to manually process it. This is quicker and consistent with how GPs receive other forms of communication.</p>

                <p>All the messages are sent with structured information. Structured information is the key to interoperability. It allows clinical information to flow across care settings and from one system to another seamlessly. The details are in a standardised format and are computer readable. TPP SystmOne can currently consume the structured element of the information, whereas EMIS are still working on this.</p>

                <p>The content of the electronic notification is based on the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://theprsb.org/standards/pharmacyinformationflows1and2/">pharmacy information flows data standard</a> developed in partnership with the Professional Record Standards Body (PRSB).</p>

                <p>Once added to the patient’s record, the practice can update the patient’s Summary Care Record (SCR) so the information is available to other care providers.</p>

                <p>All four suppliers – TPP, Pinnacle, EMIS and Sonar – have achieved full roll-out approval for urgent supply notifications. Three of them have gone live across all their sites and EMIS are in the very last stages of going live.</p>

                <p>TPP and Pinnacle are live with flu notifications. EMIS and Sonar are aiming to be ready for the coming flu season. The importance of receiving notifications in this way is likely to be greater this year. If the pharmacy has administered a flu vaccine for a patient, the GP updates the patient’s record and does not continue to contact that patient to offer the vaccine again.</p>

                <p>This will be useful considering the government is introducing flu vaccinations for everyone over the age of 50. This amounts to around 30 million patients. Those over 65 and with medical conditions will continue to be a priority in the vaccination programme. It is good preparation for a busy winter when we might be subject to a potential second wave of COVID-19.</p>

                <p><strong>At the start of the coronavirus crisis in March, GP practices faced a major challenge in dealing with its poorly patients. To prevent further spread of the virus, GPs had to ask people to take part in online or telephone consultations rather than physically attend the practice.</strong></p>

                <p>As the crisis developed, people were making calls to NHS 111 and then being referred to pharmacies as part of the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/primary-care/pharmacy/community-pharmacist-consultation-service/">Community Pharmacist Consultation Service</a> to get urgent medication. This initiative proved invaluable at a time when community pharmacies became the only primary care service to be operating largely business as usual.</p>

                <p>However, it was more important than ever for GPs to be kept up-to-date on what medication their patients were receiving so the GPs didn’t re-supply the drugs unnecessarily. &nbsp;GPs had been used to receiving these notifications from pharmacies by either NHSmail, fax or paper. This was an inefficient way of sharing information and meant practice staff had to manually update patients’ records – this took valuable time and was prone to transcribing errors.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, a digital solution had been created last Autumn to ensure notifications were shared and received swiftly, accurately, safely and consistently for flu vaccinations administered by community pharmacists.</p>

                <p>The new method of digital notifications was implemented for the flu season, initially with one GP system (TPP SystmOne) and one pharmacy system (Pinnacle PharmOutcomes) to ensure GPs knew which patients had received the flu vaccine.</p>

                <p>Then, at the beginning of 2020, this initiative expanded to include the notification of urgent supplies of medicines via the Community Pharmacist Consultation Service. This allows patients who have run out of their prescribed medicines to get a supply directly from a community pharmacy if their GP surgery was closed, for example, over the weekend.</p>

                <p>Up to now, it has involved working with four suppliers who own the two pharmacy systems, PharmOutcomes and Sonar Informatics, and two GP systems, EMIS Web and TPP SystmOne.</p>

                <p>The notifications are sent as a structured <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-apis">FHIR message</a> from a community pharmacy’s clinical system via the Message Exchange for Social Care and Health (MESH) directly to a patient’s GP practice, where it is received as a workflow task in the practice’s clinical system. The task has an attached PDF which contains all the details.</p>

                <p>Online consultation technology is crucial in helping quickly achieve total triage while preserving good standards of care – and due to their ease of use apps like the NHS App are an ideal platform for driving the rapid adoption of this technology. Where possible each enquiry or online consultation will be passed to the patient’s regular GP or member of the team.</p>

                <p>We are continuing to work at an unprecedented pace to integrate online consultation in the NHS App to respond to the pandemic.</p>

                <p>After a successful pilot using the eConsult solution earlier this year, we had planned a national rollout to about 1,200 GP practices by the end of June 2020. Those targets are already in the rear-view mirror. By 30 April 2020, eConsult was available through the app to more than 2,200 practices, covering 20 million patients.</p>

                <p>Early feedback has been positive. Users are finding and using the online consultation service in the app and we’ve received emails from GP practices telling us how they’re finding the feature useful.</p>

                <p>As we work with more online consultation suppliers on how to best integrate their products into the NHS App, our goal is that an even larger number of patients will be able to ask for help and advice from their GP surgery through this route in the future.</p>

                <p>Long before any of us had heard of coronavirus or social distancing, we were already working with suppliers to integrate their services into the NHS App. Matthew Gould, Chief Executive of NHSX, explained this approach in a <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/31/the-nhs-app-a-platform-for-innovation/">blog post</a> last year – how we would keep the NHS App ‘thin’ and let innovators build on it.</p>

                <p>This means that people accessing online consultations in the NHS App have a consistent user interface, through which we can simplify and improve their user journeys, no matter which supplier their GP practice uses.</p>

                <p>In the current situation this is invaluable and helps to rapidly drive uptake of online consultations on a platform that people understand and trust in a crisis.</p>

                <p>Our first supplier to emerge from the process is eConsult but we are not adopting a single-supplier solution. In early 2019, we conducted market research with the NHS England Primary Care team, completed a supplier analysis and chose eConsult to do a proof of concept. We wanted to see what the architecture could look like for implementing online consultations within the NHS App.</p>

                <p>We followed this up by going live with a pilot of eight practices from November 2019 to January 2020 using eConsult, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. This provided the foundation for the national roll out.</p>

                <p>From our user-testing, we found that a tight-knit integration, where the user doesn’t leave the NHS App, works best from a user’s perspective. A <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-apis">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based API</a> was the preferred method of doing this.</p>

                <p>Following the FHIR standards, we built an API that can talk to multiple suppliers and the data they send us. If a supplier builds a Clinical Decision Support (CDS) API following the FHIR standards, we can consume their solution in one integration.</p>

                <p>This allows us to easily add in new suppliers with limited additional work. It also allows practices to switch suppliers without needing any rework on the solution. This gives them the flexibility to link with locally commissioned digital services, because we know that local areas often know what is best for them and their patients.</p>

                <p>Online consultation technology is crucial in helping quickly achieve total triage while preserving good standards of care – and due to their ease of use apps like the NHS App are an ideal platform for driving the rapid adoption of this technology.

                <p>From our user-testing, we found that a tight-knit integration, where the user doesn’t leave the NHS App, works best from a user’s perspective. A <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-apis">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based API</a> was the preferred method of doing this.</p>

                <p>Following the FHIR standards, we built an API that can talk to multiple suppliers and the data they send us. If a supplier builds a Clinical Decision Support (CDS) API following the FHIR standards, we can consume their solution in one integration.</p>

                <p>This allows us to easily add in new suppliers with limited additional work. It also allows practices to switch suppliers without needing any rework on the solution.

                <p><span><span>There’s also a section on designing content for users with low <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/content/health-literacy">health literacy</a>. More than 4 in 10 adults struggle with health content for the public and more than 6 in 10 adults struggle with health content that includes numbers and statistics.

                <p><span><span>We recently published some guidance on <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms">how to write good questions for forms</a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>Our research showed us that digital teams working in health need guidance on asking sensitive questions. Sensitive questions often relate to the "protected characteristics" in the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents">Equality Act 2010</a> and these are questions people may be reluctant to answer: for example, questions about their sex or gender, their age or mental health. Often forms ask unnecessary questions. That’s why the guidance is designed to help teams ask only the questions they really need to ask and explain why they need to ask.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>The guidance also helps teams think beyond binary choices. Forms often ask “Yes” or “No” questions but people may want to give you another answer, like "I don't know" or “I’m not sure”. We recommend that teams always try out a 3rd option in their user research, for example with a box to type in something other than "Yes" or "No".</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>"Other" can be a good alternative to “Yes” or “No” but you need to be wary of using it when you're collecting personal data or with sensitive topics, like ethnicity. It can make people feel that you do not care enough about their personal circumstances to be specific.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>The language around sex, gender and sexuality, in particular, changes all the time and it's an area that people hold strong and differing opinions about. We try to make sure that we are in touch with the communities we are writing for and we update our guidance regularly.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>We published an updated <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/content/inclusive-language">inclusive language</a> page in August and got lots of comments on it - positive and negative. We looked at all the feedback, consulted further and have addressed the issues that people raised.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>In particular, some people didn’t like us talking about sex or gender being “assigned at birth”. They said, for example, that sex is described, observed or noted at birth or in a scan. But we know that many trans people prefer the word “assigned”, and the midwives we’ve talked to use it too.</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>We’ve looked at user research, including the work of colleagues at the Office for National Statistics.&nbsp;We decided to use the phrase “sex assigned at birth” when we’re talking about trans health and gender dysphoria, as this is the language our audience uses. </span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>In other cases, we use “the sex someone was registered with at birth” because user research shows that most people understand this better as it refers to an actual event.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>We also had a lot of feedback about the terms “intersex” and “differences of sex development” (DSD). Some people prefer one term, some the other.

                <p><span><span>Our research showed us that digital teams working in health need guidance on asking sensitive questions. Sensitive questions often relate to the "protected characteristics" in the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents">Equality Act 2010</a> and these are questions people may be reluctant to answer: for example, questions about their sex or gender, their age or mental health. Often forms ask unnecessary questions. That’s why the guidance is designed to help teams ask only the questions they really need to ask and explain why they need to ask.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>The guidance also helps teams think beyond binary choices. Forms often ask “Yes” or “No” questions but people may want to give you another answer, like "I don't know" or “I’m not sure”. We recommend that teams always try out a 3rd option in their user research, for example with a box to type in something other than "Yes" or "No".</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>"Other" can be a good alternative to “Yes” or “No” but you need to be wary of using it when you're collecting personal data or with sensitive topics, like ethnicity. It can make people feel that you do not care enough about their personal circumstances to be specific.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>In other cases, we use “the sex someone was registered with at birth” because user research shows that most people understand this better as it refers to an actual event.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>We also had a lot of feedback about the terms “intersex” and “differences of sex development” (DSD). Some people prefer one term, some the other.

                <p><span><span>We’ve looked at user research, including the work of colleagues at the Office for National Statistics.&nbsp;We decided to use the phrase “sex assigned at birth” when we’re talking about trans health and gender dysphoria, as this is the language our audience uses. </span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>In other cases, we use “the sex someone was registered with at birth” because user research shows that most people understand this better as it refers to an actual event.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>We also had a lot of feedback about the terms “intersex” and “differences of sex development” (DSD). Some people prefer one term, some the other. We’ve made this clear in our guidance and we recommend, as always, that teams test their language with the people who’ll be using their content or service.​</span></span></p>

                <p><span><span>We’ve just published another update to <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/content/inclusive-language">our page on inclusive language</a>. The guidance there should help you get started but, when you do your user research, you may find that something else works better. There is no one right answer. Please let us know what you find.</span></span></p>

                <p>This is what Google call a 'knowledge panel'.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>These panels have been used for a range of topics for a while now, but in the UK they had never been used for health information.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>From this week, thanks to the hard work of the team, anyone who searches Google on a mobile device can find knowledge panels with reliable and authoritative health information on more than 250 conditions from the NHS website. This can help more people learn about common conditions, symptoms and treatments more quickly and easily than ever before.</p>

                <p>To allow NHS website content to appear in knowledge panels, we had to “modularise” our content by adding structured data mark-up based on open Schema.org standards.</p>

                <p>We talked about <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2020/an-update-on-nhs-website-modularised-content">the work to modularise NHS website content in a previous blog post.</a>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In a nutshell, this involves adding mark-up to our pages to identify the specific sections of content. For example, on our pages on medical conditions we can mark-up the sections about symptoms or treatments.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The sections of marked-up content can then be used by anyone who wants them, either by using the JSON+LD script in our page code or the free NHS API or widgets.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We’ve added structured data mark-up to more than 250 of the most popular topics on the NHS website.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>You’ve probably noticed that for some Google searches using your mobile – for example, about an actor or film – you get a section at the top of your results with a summary of information from sources like Wikipedia or IMDB.</p>

                <p><img src="google_1920.jpg/{_document}/hippogallery:original" alt="Google knowledge panel for the United Kingdom" /></p>

                <p>This is what Google call a 'knowledge panel'.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>These panels have been used for a range of topics for a while now, but in the UK they had never been used for health information.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>From this week, thanks to the hard work of the team, anyone who searches Google on a mobile device can find knowledge panels with reliable and authoritative health information on more than 250 conditions from the NHS website. This can help more people learn about common conditions, symptoms and treatments more quickly and easily than ever before.</p>

                <p>To allow NHS website content to appear in knowledge panels, we had to “modularise” our content by adding structured data mark-up based on open Schema.org standards.</p>

                <p>We talked about <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2020/an-update-on-nhs-website-modularised-content">the work to modularise NHS website content in a previous blog post.</a>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In a nutshell, this involves adding mark-up to our pages to identify the specific sections of content. For example, on our pages on medical conditions we can mark-up the sections about symptoms or treatments.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The sections of marked-up content can then be used by anyone who wants them, either by using the JSON+LD script in our page code or the free NHS API or widgets.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We’ve added structured data mark-up to more than 250 of the most popular topics on the NHS website.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Sections we marked-up included:</p>

                <p>During this work, we’ve helped develop a new open Schema.org standard for marking-up health information (called HealthTopicContent), which will make it easier for others to correctly mark-up their health content.</p>

                <p>You’ve probably noticed that for some Google searches using your mobile – for example, about an actor or film – you get a section at the top of your results with a summary of information from sources like Wikipedia or IMDB.</p>

                <p>This is what Google call a 'knowledge panel'.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>These panels have been used for a range of topics for a while now, but in the UK they had never been used for health information.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>From this week, thanks to the hard work of the team, anyone who searches Google on a mobile device can find knowledge panels with reliable and authoritative health information on more than 250 conditions from the NHS website. This can help more people learn about common conditions, symptoms and treatments more quickly and easily than ever before.</p>

                <p>To allow NHS website content to appear in knowledge panels, we had to “modularise” our content by adding structured data mark-up based on open Schema.org standards.</p>

                <p>We talked about <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2020/an-update-on-nhs-website-modularised-content">the work to modularise NHS website content in a previous blog post.</a>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In a nutshell, this involves adding mark-up to our pages to identify the specific sections of content. For example, on our pages on medical conditions we can mark-up the sections about symptoms or treatments.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The sections of marked-up content can then be used by anyone who wants them, either by using the JSON+LD script in our page code or the free NHS API or widgets.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We’ve added structured data mark-up to more than 250 of the most popular topics on the NHS website.&nbsp;</p>

But that also means the opportunity for improvement is significant.</p>

                <p><span><span><span>We are delivering three important improvements to workflows and to integration with local processes. </span></span></span></p>

                <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A new Joiners, Movers, Leavers (JML) product integrates the Electronic Staff Record, NHSmail, and local directory services. It automates the movement of user accounts between NHSmail organisations, the synchronisation of attributes and the commissioning and de-commissioning of local identities in the active directories.&nbsp; When fully implemented, this process is expected to save around 40,000 hours a year, leading to millions of pounds worth of efficiency savings.</p>

                <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A password synchronisation micro-service allows users to synchronise their password from the NHS Directory to their local active directory services and vice versa. This will also improve user experiences by delivering a same sign-on experience regardless of whether they authenticate for services against the NHS Directory or local Active Directory services. It will also improve cyber security by reducing the number of passwords users need to manage, reducing the temptation to store them in an insecure way – such as post-its with user-names and passwords written on them and stuck to desktop or laptop monitors.</p>

                <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Behavioural and transactional analysis will allow us to identify patterns in user behaviour and associated digital transactions to help pinpoint anomalous events. For example, if a user attempts to authenticate a service from an unusual location or an odd time or date the service can block authorisation in case the account has been compromised.</p>

                <p><span><span><span>These new services build on a series of improvements to the NHSmail platform over the past year, including:</span></span></span></p>

                burden on back offices across the NHS. Local organisations have had

But that also means the opportunity for improvement is significant.</p>

                <p><span><span><span>We are delivering three important improvements to workflows and to integration with local processes. </span></span></span></p>

                <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A new Joiners, Movers, Leavers (JML) product integrates the Electronic Staff Record, NHSmail, and local directory services. It automates the movement of user accounts between NHSmail organisations, the synchronisation of attributes and the commissioning and de-commissioning of local identities in the active directories.&nbsp; When fully implemented, this process is expected to save around 40,000 hours a year, leading to millions of pounds worth of efficiency savings.</p>

                <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A password synchronisation micro-service allows users to synchronise their password from the NHS Directory to their local active directory services and vice versa. This will also improve user experiences by delivering a same sign-on experience regardless of whether they authenticate for services against the NHS Directory or local Active Directory services. It will also improve cyber security by reducing the number of passwords users need to manage, reducing the temptation to store them in an insecure way – such as post-its with user-names and passwords written on them and stuck to desktop or laptop monitors.</p>

                <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Behavioural and transactional analysis will allow us to identify patterns in user behaviour and associated digital transactions to help pinpoint anomalous events. For example, if a user attempts to authenticate a service from an unusual location or an odd time or date the service can block authorisation in case the account has been compromised.</p>

                <p><span><span><span>These new services build on a series of improvements to the NHSmail platform over the past year, including:</span></span></span></p>

                and a bit technical, but the reality is that all of this has put significant
                burden on back offices across the NHS. Local organisations have had
                to manually manage employees that join, move or leave their roles

                <p>With more than 13,000 health and care organisations in England and Scotland using NHSmail and 64,000 movements of user accounts every month, the burden is real and the security implications relating to identity are acute. But that also means the opportunity for improvement is significant.</p>

                <p><span><span><span>We are delivering three important improvements to workflows and to integration with local processes. </span></span></span></p>

                <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A new Joiners, Movers, Leavers (JML) product integrates the Electronic Staff Record, NHSmail, and local directory services. It automates the movement of user accounts between NHSmail organisations, the synchronisation of attributes and the commissioning and de-commissioning of local identities in the active directories.&nbsp; When fully implemented, this process is expected to save around 40,000 hours a year, leading to millions of pounds worth of efficiency savings.</p>

                <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A password synchronisation micro-service allows users to synchronise their password from the NHS Directory to their local active directory services and vice versa. This will also improve user experiences by delivering a same sign-on experience regardless of whether they authenticate for services against the NHS Directory or local Active Directory services. It will also improve cyber security by reducing the number of passwords users need to manage, reducing the temptation to store them in an insecure way – such as post-its with user-names and passwords written on them and stuck to desktop or laptop monitors.</p>

                <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Behavioural and transactional analysis will allow us to identify patterns in user behaviour and associated digital transactions to help pinpoint anomalous events. For example, if a user attempts to authenticate a service from an unusual location or an odd time or date the service can block authorisation in case the account has been compromised.</p>

                <p><span><span><span>These new services build on a series of improvements to the NHSmail platform over the past year, including:</span></span></span></p>

                <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds enormous potential for the NHS, if we can use it right. &nbsp;It can reduce the burden on the system by taking on the tasks that can be converted into an algorithm. Many of these are in areas of greatest pressure, like radiography and pathology. It could improve patient outcomes, and increase productivity across the system, freeing up clinicians’ time so they can focus on the parts of the job where they add the most value.</strong></p>

                <p>But doing AI right means putting a set of rules around it that will make sure it is done safely, in a way that respects patients’ privacy and keeps the confidence of citizens and staff. Some of those rules already exist - like the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted">2018 Data Protection Act</a>, for example, which put GDPR into UK law. But there are gaps, lots of regulators on the pitch, and a lack of clarity on both standards and roles. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>This carries two risks. &nbsp;First, and most importantly, that AI will be used that is unsafe. Second, and more likely, that the opportunity to use AI to help patients will be wasted or delayed, as both clinicians and innovators hold back until they know there is a regulatory framework that gives them cover.</p>

                <p>Smart regulation could really help make the UK the best place in the world to develop AI in health. The benefits will be huge if we can find the sweet spot, where we maintain the trust that AI is being used properly and safely, while creating a space in which compliant innovation can flourish.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We aren’t there yet. There are multiple regulators involved, creating a bewildering array of bodies for innovators to navigate and creating confusion for organisations in the NHS and social care who want to make the most of these innovations. We haven’t worked out yet how to regulate Machine Learning - systems that are constantly iterating their algorithms, often at huge speed and for reasons that are not always transparent, even to their creators. We have not created a clear path for innovators for how they get regulatory approval for their AI systems.</p>

                <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds enormous potential for the NHS, if we can use it right. &nbsp;It can reduce the burden on the system by taking on the tasks that can be converted into an algorithm. Many of these are in areas of greatest pressure, like radiography and pathology. It could improve patient outcomes, and increase productivity across the system, freeing up clinicians’ time so they can focus on the parts of the job where they add the most value.</strong></p>

                <p>But doing AI right means putting a set of rules around it that will make sure it is done safely, in a way that respects patients’ privacy and keeps the confidence of citizens and staff. Some of those rules already exist - like the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted">2018 Data Protection Act</a>, for example, which put GDPR into UK law. But there are gaps, lots of regulators on the pitch, and a lack of clarity on both standards and roles. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>This carries two risks. &nbsp;First, and most importantly, that AI will be used that is unsafe. Second, and more likely, that the opportunity to use AI to help patients will be wasted or delayed, as both clinicians and innovators hold back until they know there is a regulatory framework that gives them cover.</p>

                <p>Smart regulation could really help make the UK the best place in the world to develop AI in health. The benefits will be huge if we can find the sweet spot, where we maintain the trust that AI is being used properly and safely, while creating a space in which compliant innovation can flourish.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We aren’t there yet. There are multiple regulators involved, creating a bewildering array of bodies for innovators to navigate and creating confusion for organisations in the NHS and social care who want to make the most of these innovations. We haven’t worked out yet how to regulate Machine Learning - systems that are constantly iterating their algorithms, often at huge speed and for reasons that are not always transparent, even to their creators. We have not created a clear path for innovators for how they get regulatory approval for their AI systems.</p>

                Learning. &nbsp;We know it’s difficult, but we need to develop a proposal,
                test it, iterate, and keep iterating. There is a lot of brilliant
                thinking around the world on this - we will gather it, convene experts,
                practitioners and regulators, and get moving. &nbsp;As this is - at
                this stage - a question of policy, we will lead it from NHSX in the
                first instance before passing a plan to regulators to implement;</p>

                <p>In all this, the NHS AI Lab will play an important role, not least as a source of funding for regulators to stand up the capability they need to do this work. &nbsp;The lab will have regulation as one of its core streams of activity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>It’s a huge agenda. &nbsp;But it really matters, and we need to move this all forward at pace. &nbsp;The prize - if we can get this right - is making the UK a world leader in AI for health, giving the NHS the benefits of this new technology safely, reducing the burden on its staff and improving outcomes for patients. &nbsp;<br />

                <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds enormous potential for the NHS, if we can use it right. &nbsp;It can reduce the burden on the system by taking on the tasks that can be converted into an algorithm. Many of these are in areas of greatest pressure, like radiography and pathology. It could improve patient outcomes, and increase productivity across the system, freeing up clinicians’ time so they can focus on the parts of the job where they add the most value.</strong></p>

                <p>But doing AI right means putting a set of rules around it that will make sure it is done safely, in a way that respects patients’ privacy and keeps the confidence of citizens and staff. Some of those rules already exist - like the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted">2018 Data Protection Act</a>, for example, which put GDPR into UK law. But there are gaps, lots of regulators on the pitch, and a lack of clarity on both standards and roles. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>This carries two risks. &nbsp;First, and most importantly, that AI will be used that is unsafe. Second, and more likely, that the opportunity to use AI to help patients will be wasted or delayed, as both clinicians and innovators hold back until they know there is a regulatory framework that gives them cover.</p>

                <p>Smart regulation could really help make the UK the best place in the world to develop AI in health. The benefits will be huge if we can find the sweet spot, where we maintain the trust that AI is being used properly and safely, while creating a space in which compliant innovation can flourish.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We aren’t there yet. There are multiple regulators involved, creating a bewildering array of bodies for innovators to navigate and creating confusion for organisations in the NHS and social care who want to make the most of these innovations. We haven’t worked out yet how to regulate Machine Learning - systems that are constantly iterating their algorithms, often at huge speed and for reasons that are not always transparent, even to their creators. We have not created a clear path for innovators for how they get regulatory approval for their AI systems.</p>

                <p>This is why I convened the CEOs and heads of all the 12 regulators and organisations involved. It included MHRA, NICE, CQC, the Information Commissioner, the National Data Guardian, the Health Research Authority, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, NHSD, NHSR, the Better Regulation Executive and the MRC (the full list of participants is below).</p>

                <p>We met on 28 January, and spent three hours working through the issues. &nbsp;There was complete agreement that we needed to get on with this, and get in place the clear, innovation-friendly processes and regulations we need. &nbsp; In particular, we agreed that we need:</p>

                regulatory strands together to create a single point of contact, advice
                and engagement. &nbsp;And we will work closely with colleagues across

                <p>It’s a huge agenda. &nbsp;But it really matters, and we need to move this all forward at pace. &nbsp;The prize - if we can get this right - is making the UK a world leader in AI for health, giving the NHS the benefits of this new technology safely, reducing the burden on its staff and improving outcomes for patients. &nbsp;<br />

                <p><strong>Like everywhere else in the country, our urology department has had to transform the way we work during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. &nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p>We used to rely upon multiple face-to-face meetings each day to collaborate with colleagues and ensure high quality care for patients and the smooth operation of the hospital.&nbsp; However, the COVID-19 situation blew all that apart.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We were told to hold all meetings and conversations remotely and in a short space of time, our department converted our face-to-face work practices into a remote format using Microsoft Teams.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The Digital Healthcare team at UCLH rapidly set up a Remote Working support team and information mini-site on the intranet as they rolled out a variety of remote working tools to enable home working. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>The training for Microsoft Teams was tailored according to our pre-existing knowledge of the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp; We needed to know how to download software, log-in and use Microsoft Teams chat and meetings functions.&nbsp; Given the rapid speed with which we had to establish remote meetings, several staff members were provided with one-to-one assistance to help get started.</p>

                <p>There was constant troubleshooting required over the first few weeks, such as people not muting on joining a call to avoid background noise (especially those on trains), learning not to join with two devices in the same room and people calling others by accident.</p>

                <p>Another issue for us was ensuring staff logged in with their NHS email rather than their UCL email as we found chats didn’t work with the UCL email.</p>

                <p>I devised some Teams etiquette to deal with these issues, plus I thought it was a good idea to remind anyone who was running the meeting to introduce those who were joining from the room (so that people joining remotely knew who was present). I incorporated the etiquette into a set of instructions for people in the department to easily refer to if they got stuck.</p>

                <p>It wasn’t long before everyone was using the technology expertly.</p>

                Teams has improved the flexibility and efficiency with which we conduct

                to build upon on the long road to recovery.</p>

                <p><strong>Like everywhere else in the country, our urology department has had to transform the way we work during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. &nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p>We used to rely upon multiple face-to-face meetings each day to collaborate with colleagues and ensure high quality care for patients and the smooth operation of the hospital.&nbsp; However, the COVID-19 situation blew all that apart.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We were told to hold all meetings and conversations remotely and in a short space of time, our department converted our face-to-face work practices into a remote format using Microsoft Teams.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Staff members had different levels of familiarity with Microsoft Teams, and yet everyone showed great enthusiasm in embracing a completely new format for their daily work routine.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The Digital Healthcare team at UCLH rapidly set up a Remote Working support team and information mini-site on the intranet as they rolled out a variety of remote working tools to enable home working. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>The training for Microsoft Teams was tailored according to our pre-existing knowledge of the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp; We needed to know how to download software, log-in and use Microsoft Teams chat and meetings functions.&nbsp; Given the rapid speed with which we had to establish remote meetings, several staff members were provided with one-to-one assistance to help get started.</p>

                <p>There was constant troubleshooting required over the first few weeks, such as people not muting on joining a call to avoid background noise (especially those on trains), learning not to join with two devices in the same room and people calling others by accident.</p>

                <p>Another issue for us was ensuring staff logged in with their NHS email rather than their UCL email as we found chats didn’t work with the UCL email.</p>

                <p>I devised some Teams etiquette to deal with these issues, plus I thought it was a good idea to remind anyone who was running the meeting to introduce those who were joining from the room (so that people joining remotely knew who was present). I incorporated the etiquette into a set of instructions for people in the department to easily refer to if they got stuck.</p>

                <p>It wasn’t long before everyone was using the technology expertly.</p>

                <p>Before, it would not have been possible to get relevant medical staff together for such a meeting due to their existing work commitments at different sites, so this ability to provide input from wherever they are, has been invaluable. Without a doubt, it has promoted exceptional teamwork and co-operation and provided fantastic teaching for junior doctors.</p>

                <p>All this helps us provide better care for the patients and in addition the new meeting format has helped us to speed up discharge processes and limit patient time within the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Most </span></span></span><span><span>people still have no idea what I’m talking about at dinner parties. However, <span>where it matters, there has been a&nbsp;significant change in awareness. At a recent national conference for providers of mental health services, not only did everyone know what SNOMED CT was, but a mental health trust was giving advice on its implementation. This was a first, although the number of people who don’t know what SNOMED CT is has been reducing year on year.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>I’m proud of how far the health system has come in the last 10 years. In a few months’ time, almost all GP practices in England will use SNOMED CT. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

By standardising how we describe and code health, care and treatment, we allow NHS IT systems to talk efficiently to one another.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span class="A2"><span><span>It’s like using a supermarket website as opposed to compiling a free text shopping list. You might write down that you want a can of baked beans, but it won’t be clear if you require a small, medium or large tin. However, if you have to select it from a list of 200g, 300g and 400g, you know what you have ordered and so does the retailer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>This interoperability releases the efficient flow of data and allows for better patient care and resource management, time-savings for clinicians, improved data collection, and the ability to harness real-time data to support clinicians in their decision-making. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>For example, when key partners TPP and EMIS integrated SNOMED CT into their general practice systems, we discovered that guidance which enables suppliers to provide clinical calculators and alerts in their systems were often only provided in the old CTV3 or READ v2 codes.

                <p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Ten years ago, when I took up my role to support SNOMED CT implementation, I realised very quickly that no one knew what it was, let alone recognised its benefits. </span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Most </span></span></span><span><span>people still have no idea what I’m talking about at dinner parties. However, <span>where it matters, there has been a&nbsp;significant change in awareness. At a recent national conference for providers of mental health services, not only did everyone know what SNOMED CT was, but a mental health trust was giving advice on its implementation. This was a first, although the number of people who don’t know what SNOMED CT is has been reducing year on year.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>I’m proud of how far the health system has come in the last 10 years. In a few months’ time, almost all GP practices in England will use SNOMED CT. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span class="A2"><span><span>It’s like using a supermarket website as opposed to compiling a free text shopping list. You might write down that you want a can of baked beans, but it won’t be clear if you require a small, medium or large tin. However, if you have to select it from a list of 200g, 300g and 400g, you know what you have ordered and so does the retailer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>This interoperability releases the efficient flow of data and allows for better patient care and resource management, time-savings for clinicians, improved data collection, and the ability to harness real-time data to support clinicians in their decision-making. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>Moving to SNOMED CT in general practice was a bit like undertaking a major stock take. It turned over stones that hadn’t been turned over in a while and revealed differences in approaches between suppliers. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>For example, when key partners TPP and EMIS integrated SNOMED CT into their general practice systems, we discovered that guidance which enables suppliers to provide clinical calculators and alerts in their systems were often only provided in the old CTV3 or READ v2 codes. SNOMED CT replaces these codes so that system providers are all working with the same terminology – this means that no matter which supplier a GP practice uses, the alerts they receive will all be based on the same logic.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Ten years ago, when I took up my role to support SNOMED CT implementation, I realised very quickly that no one knew what it was, let alone recognised its benefits. </span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Most </span></span></span><span><span>people still have no idea what I’m talking about at dinner parties. However, <span>where it matters, there has been a&nbsp;significant change in awareness. At a recent national conference for providers of mental health services, not only did everyone know what SNOMED CT was, but a mental health trust was giving advice on its implementation. This was a first, although the number of people who don’t know what SNOMED CT is has been reducing year on year.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>I’m proud of how far the health system has come in the last 10 years. In a few months’ time, almost all GP practices in England will use SNOMED CT. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>Moving to SNOMED CT in general practice was a bit like undertaking a major stock take. It turned over stones that hadn’t been turned over in a while and revealed differences in approaches between suppliers. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>For example, when key partners TPP and EMIS integrated SNOMED CT into their general practice systems, we discovered that guidance which enables suppliers to provide clinical calculators and alerts in their systems were often only provided in the old CTV3 or READ v2 codes. SNOMED CT replaces these codes so that system providers are all working with the same terminology – this means that no matter which supplier a GP practice uses, the alerts they receive will all be based on the same logic.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>These webinar sessions ranged from a general overview and discussion of the key time-saving benefits of moving to SNOMED CT for audiences that only needed the basics, to more technical presentations for those writing queries and business rules.

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>A tipping point in gaining the support of clinicians occurred when they learned of the cost-saving and time-saving benefits of using SNOMED CT. For example, GP surgeries receive over two million A&amp;E discharge letters per month that need to be coded. Receiving these letters in SNOMED CT removes the need for practices to do this themselves. If we estimate a cost-saving of two minutes per letter, this results in an average saving of over two hours of staff time per practice, per week. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p><span><span><span><span><span>We also engaged with the Joint GP IT Committee, who fully support the move to using SNOMED CT as a universal language. They continue to increase awareness and uptake of SNOMED CT by providing advice and written updates to their members.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

We’re currently engaging with our colleagues in mental health to record more information via structured data, rather than only using supplementary notes. Research is also underway in partnership with Great Ormond Street Hospital to explore transforming clinician notes to incorporate SNOMED CT. This will help to collect quality data to understand which interventions improve clinical outcomes.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

                <p>Some GPs have reported being overwhelmed with complex requests for data. There is a difficult balance here. Researchers, policy makers and system managers urgently need this information to fulfil their roles and carry out vital research during the outbreak — but general practices must be allowed to concentrate on the provision of frontline services.</p>

                <p>Following the request from the BMA and the RCGP, we came up with a tactical solution to support vital coronavirus&nbsp;planning and research and to reduce burden on general practices so they are freed up to focus on patient care. One&nbsp;particular benefit to information governance leads and practice managers will be that we will take over the burden and complexity of assessing applications to access GP data, and become the responsible party and data controller for tightly controlled access and dissemination of the data.</p>

                <p>Some GPs have reported being overwhelmed with complex requests for data. There is a difficult balance here. Researchers, policy makers and system managers urgently need this information to fulfil their roles and carry out vital research during the outbreak — but general practices must be allowed to concentrate on the provision of frontline services.</p>

                <p>Following the request from the BMA and the RCGP, we came up with a tactical solution to support vital coronavirus&nbsp;planning and research and to reduce burden on general practices so they are freed up to focus on patient care. One&nbsp;particular benefit to information governance leads and practice managers will be that we will take over the burden and complexity of assessing applications to access GP data, and become the responsible party and data controller for tightly controlled access and dissemination of the data.</p>
