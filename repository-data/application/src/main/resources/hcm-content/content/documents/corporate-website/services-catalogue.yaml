              <p>An ‘interoperability standard’ describes a standardised set of rules, that govern the format, language and delivery methods for transferring data or information from any healthcare IT system to another. In the case of BaRS, it helps a service to send or receive booking and referral information to or from another care provider for the purpose of a patient's ongoing care.</p>

              <p>If all care settings adopt the same interoperability standard for sending and receiving referrals, it makes it easier, faster and safer to move patients through their care journey.</p>
