        <p>NHS Digital regards the fair and lawful processing of personal information as essential in order to successfully achieve its objectives and ensure the support and confidence of the general public and stakeholders.</p>

        <p>Notification is a statutory requirement and every organisation that processes personal information must notify the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), unless they are exempt. Failure to notify is a criminal offence.</p>

        <p>As a data controller NHS Digital provides the ICO with details about their processing of personal information. The ICO publishes certain details in the register of data controllers, including the name and address of data controllers and a description of the kind of processing they do. You can read this register on the&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="http://www.ico.org.uk/">ICO website (external).</a></p>

        <p>The Principles of The Data Protection Act 1998, as set out below are fully endorsed by NHS Digital. The eight principles require that personal information:</p>

        <p>1. Shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless specific conditions are met.</p>

        <p>2. Shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose of those purposes.</p>

        <p>3. Shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed</p>

        <p>4. Shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date</p>

        <p>5. Shall not be kept for longer that is necessary for the specified purpose(s)</p>

        <p>6. Shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under the Act</p>

        <p>7. Should be subject to appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent the unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data, or the accidental loss, destruction, or damage to personal data</p>

        <p>8. Shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European economic area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.</p>
