            API","description":"## Overview\nUse this API standard to build an API
            that [Digital Staff Passport (DSP)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport)
            can use to interact with your system.\n\nThe standard currently supports
            the following use cases:\n\n| Use case                              |
            External system type       |\n| -------------------------------------
            | -------------------------- |\n| Get core skills                       |
            Learning management system |\n| Send core skills                      |
            Learning management system |\n| Send right to work information        |
            Recruitment system         |\n| Send DBS check supporting information
            | Recruitment system         |\n\nFor more context, see [Integrating with
            the Digital Staf Passport](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration),
            specifically:\n- [integration pattern 2](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration#pattern-2-outbound-via-online-portal)\n-
            [integration pattern 4](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration#pattern-4-inbound-via-online-portal)\n\n##
            Who can use this API standard\nYou can only use this API standard if you
            are integrating your system with Digital Staff Passport.\n\n## How this
            API standard works\nDSP needs to interact with a variety of external systems,
            to send and receive a variety of information.\nThis API standard provides
            a common approach regardless of the type of external system, as explained
            below.\n\n### Employee linking\nBefore DSP can exchange information with
            an external system, it needs to ''link'' the employee record using the
            external systems''s unique identifier for that employee.\n\nThere are
            two ways DSP can do this:\n- if the DSP user knows the employee''s external
            system ID, DSP can use the [Get employee personal details](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-)
            operation to allow the user to check it''s the right ID\n- if the DSP
            user doesn''t know the employee''s external system ID, DSP can use the
            [Search for an employee](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees) operation
            to find the ID based on employee details such as name and date of birth\n\n###
            Getting employee information\nGiven the employee''s external system ID,
            DSP can get information from the external system using the [Get employee
            records](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-/records)
            operation.\n\nThe type of information returned depends on the type of
            system. For example, a learning management system would return core skills
            records.\n\n### Sending employee information\nGiven the employee''s external
            system ID, DSP can send information to the external system using the [Add
            an employee record](#post-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-/records)
            operation.\n\nThe type of information sent depends on the type of system.
            For example, DSP might send identity information to a recruitment system
            in order to support varioius employment checks.\n\n## Employee record
            types\n\n### Core skills\nCore skills are a specific type of mandatory
            training that are common across all NHS organisations,\nand are generally
            aligned with the [Core Skills Training Framework (CSTF)](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/core-skills-training-framework/).\n\nCore
            skills are not always part of the CSTF.\nFor example, at the time of writing,
            Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training on Learning Disability and Autism is
            not part of the CSTF but is in scope for Digital Staff Passport.\n\nAlso,
            the Employee Staff Record (ESR) system includes a number of competencies
            which are flagged as ''CSTF'' even though they are not part of the Core
            Skills Training Framework.\nThey generally represent skills that have
            a [nationally-defined framework](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/resources/category/capabilities-frameworks/)\nsuch
            as the [Dementia skills framework](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/resources/dementia-2015-updated-2018/).\n\nFor
            the avoidance of doubt, a full list of the core skills in scope for Digital
            Staff Passport is provided in the\n[Digital Staff Passport core skills
            scope and mappings spreadsheet](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/digital-staff-passport---core-skills-scope-and-mappings.xlsx).\n\nCore
            skills records are typically held in a learning managements system (LMS).\nThis
            API standard supports:\n- DSP getting core skills from an LMS\n- DSP sending
            core skills to an LMS\n\nWhen sending and receiving core skills records,
            LMSs must follow the\n[standard naming conventions for CSTF core skills](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/images/services/cstf/CSTF%20Naming%20Conventions%20%20Competencies%20on%20ESR%20June%202019.pdf).\nTo
            help with this, mappings for the various data fields are included in the\n[Digital
            Staff Passport core skills scope and mappings spreadsheet](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/digital-staff-passport---core-skills-scope-and-mappings.xlsx).\n\nWhen
            receiving a core skill, LMSs should:\n- reject duplicates i.e. same competency
            name, same date last awarded\n- ignore the renewal period and expiry date,
            instead applying the local renewal period and re-calculating the expiry
            date\n\n### Right to work information\n[Right to work checks](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/right-work-checks-standard)
            must be performed by all NHS employers.\n\nThese checks are normally managed
            in a recruitment system.\n\nIf the employee has completed digital identity
            verification via Digital Staff Passport, this information can be used
            to support the right to work check.\n\nHence this API standard supports
            Digital Staff Passport sending right to work check information to a recruitment
            system.\n\n### DBS check supporting information\n[Criminal record (DBS)
            checks](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/criminal-record-checks-standard)
            must be performed by all NHS employers.\n\nThese checks are normally managed
            in a recruitment system.\n\nIf the employee has completed digital identity
            verification via Digital Staff Passport, this information can be used
            to support the DBS check.\n\nHence this API standard supports Digital
            Staff Passport sending DBS check supporting information to a recruitment
            system.\n\n## Status\nThis API standard is a [draft](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses),\nmeaning
            it is under development and might be subject to breaking changes.\n\n##
            Service level\nYour API must be a bronze service, meaning it is operational
            and supported during business hours.\n\nFor more details, see [service
            levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).\n\n##
            Technology\nThis API standard is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).\n\nIt
            does not conform to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir)\nglobal
            standard for health care data exchance because it is not a clinical API,
            it relates to workforce.\nThis has been agreed with the [HL7 FHIR UK Board](https://www.hl7.org.uk/register/about-hl7-uk/management-board-members/).\n\n##
            Network access\nYour API must be available on the internet.\n\n## Security
            and authorisation\nYour API must use OAuth 2.0 ''private key JWT'' to
            authenticate and authorise Digital Staff Passport as the calling system.\n\nFor
            more details, see [Authorisation using OAuth 2.0 private key JWT](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/authorisation-using-oauth-2.0-private-key-jwt).\n\n##
            Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request
            succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if it
            succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs
            to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client
            error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error
            on our server\n\nAlthough this is not a FHIR API, errors are returned
            as FHIR [OperationOutcome](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operationoutcome.html)
            resources, in line with our API design guidance.\n\nFor details of specific
            errors, see the ''Response'' section for each operation. See our [reference
            guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes)
            for more on errors.\n\n## Environments and testing\nYou''ll need to provide
            the following environments:\n\n| Environment | Suggested base URL |\n|---|---|\n|
            Integration test | `integration-test.<your domain>/dsp-api` |\n| Integration
            test | `<your domain>/dsp-api` |\n\n### Single versus multiple instance
            systems\nIf your system runs as a single instance supporting multiple
            employer organisations (sometimes called ''multiple tenant''), you should
            deploy it as per the suggested base URLs suggested above.\n\nIf you have
            a separate instance of your system per employer organisation, you should
            deploy each instance at the following base URL:\n\n`<your domain>/dsp-api/organisations/<org
            ODS code>`\n\nIn this case, you should alter the URL for the individual
            operations to exclude the `organisations/{org-id}` part, so that it isn''t
            repeated.\n\n### Integration testing\nYour integration test environment
            needs to include:\n- at least two organisations, so we can test cross-organisation
            security\n- sufficient test data to support a reasonable set of test scenarios
            - for example multiple people with the same surname or date of birth\n\n##
            Onboarding\nWe are currently running a pilot with one external system,
            so the API standard is not available for anyone else to onboard just yet.

            tools to check that the API is available and working.\n\nThe URL is `/organisations/{org-id}/_status`
            rather than just `/_status` so that it can be supported by systems that
            have separate instances deployed for each organisation.\n\nIt is based
            on the draft standard [Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-inadarei-api-health-check/).\n\nIt
            can be implemented as a ''shallow ping'' or a ''deep ping'':\n- For a
            shallow ping, the operation returns a `status` of `pass` without checking
            any dependent resources. This is the easier approach.\n- For a deep ping,
            the operation checks the status of dependent resources and returns a status
            that reflects the overall health of the service. The status of dependent
            resources is provided within the `checks` object. This approach is more
            work but allows us to react to live incidents more quickly.\n\nThe operation
            always returns an HTTP status code of 200, even if one or more of the
            dependent resources is not healthy.\nTherefore it is important for monitoring
            tools to check the `status` field in the body of the response.\n\nAll
            fields apart from `status` are optional, so the simplest possible implementation
            is a ''shallow ping'' response that always returns a single field `status`

            API","description":"## Overview\nUse this API standard to build an API
            that [Digital Staff Passport (DSP)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport)
            can use to interact with your system.\n\nThe standard currently supports
            the following use cases:\n\n| Use case                              |
            External system type       |\n| -------------------------------------
            | -------------------------- |\n| Get core skills                       |
            Learning management system |\n| Send core skills                      |
            Learning management system |\n| Send right to work information        |
            Recruitment system         |\n| Send DBS check supporting information
            | Recruitment system         |\n\nFor more context, see [Integrating with
            the Digital Staf Passport](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration),
            specifically:\n- [integration pattern 2](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration#pattern-2-outbound-via-online-portal)\n-
            [integration pattern 4](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration#pattern-4-inbound-via-online-portal)\n\n##
            Who can use this API standard\nYou can only use this API standard if you
            are integrating your system with Digital Staff Passport.\n\n## How this
            API standard works\nDSP needs to interact with a variety of external systems,
            to send and receive a variety of information.\nThis API standard provides
            a common approach regardless of the type of external system, as explained
            below.\n\n### Employee linking\nBefore DSP can exchange information with
            an external system, it needs to ''link'' the employee record using the
            external systems''s unique identifier for that employee.\n\nThere are
            two ways DSP can do this:\n- if the DSP user knows the employee''s external
            system ID, DSP can use the [Get employee personal details](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-)
            operation to allow the user to check it''s the right ID\n- if the DSP
            user doesn''t know the employee''s external system ID, DSP can use the
            [Search for an employee](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees) operation
            to find the ID based on employee details such as name and date of birth\n\n###
            Getting employee information\nGiven the employee''s external system ID,
            DSP can get information from the external system using the [Get employee
            records](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-/records)
            operation.\n\nThe type of information returned depends on the type of
            system. For example, a learning management system would return core skills
            records.\n\n### Sending employee information\nGiven the employee''s external
            system ID, DSP can send information to the external system using the [Add
            an employee record](#post-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-/records)
            operation.\n\nThe type of information sent depends on the type of system.
            For example, DSP might send identity information to a recruitment system
            in order to support varioius employment checks.\n\n## Employee record
            types\n\n### Core skills\nCore skills are a specific type of mandatory
            training that are common across all NHS organisations,\nand are generally
            aligned with the [Core Skills Training Framework (CSTF)](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/core-skills-training-framework/).\n\nCore
            skills are not always part of the CSTF.\nFor example, at the time of writing,
            Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training on Learning Disability and Autism is
            not part of the CSTF but is in scope for Digital Staff Passport.\n\nAlso,
            the Employee Staff Record (ESR) system includes a number of competencies
            which are flagged as ''CSTF'' even though they are not part of the Core
            Skills Training Framework.\nThey generally represent skills that have
            a [nationally-defined framework](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/resources/category/capabilities-frameworks/)\nsuch
            as the [Dementia skills framework](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/resources/dementia-2015-updated-2018/).\n\nFor
            the avoidance of doubt, a full list of the core skills in scope for Digital
            Staff Passport is provided in the\n[Digital Staff Passport core skills
            scope and mappings spreadsheet](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/digital-staff-passport---core-skills-scope-and-mappings.xlsx).\n\nCore
            skills records are typically held in a learning managements system (LMS).\nThis
            API standard supports:\n- DSP getting core skills from an LMS\n- DSP sending
            core skills to an LMS\n\nWhen sending and receiving core skills records,
            LMSs must follow the\n[standard naming conventions for CSTF core skills](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/images/services/cstf/CSTF%20Naming%20Conventions%20%20Competencies%20on%20ESR%20June%202019.pdf).\nTo
            help with this, mappings for the various data fields are included in the\n[Digital
            Staff Passport core skills scope and mappings spreadsheet](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/digital-staff-passport---core-skills-scope-and-mappings.xlsx).\n\nWhen
            receiving a core skill, LMSs should:\n- reject duplicates i.e. same competency
            name, same date last awarded\n- ignore the renewal period and expiry date,
            instead applying the local renewal period and re-calculating the expiry
            date\n\n### Right to work information\n[Right to work checks](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/right-work-checks-standard)
            must be performed by all NHS employers.\n\nThese checks are normally managed
            in a recruitment system.\n\nIf the employee has completed digital identity
            verification via Digital Staff Passport, this information can be used
            to support the right to work check.\n\nHence this API standard supports
            Digital Staff Passport sending right to work check information to a recruitment
            system.\n\n### DBS check supporting information\n[Criminal record (DBS)
            checks](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/criminal-record-checks-standard)
            must be performed by all NHS employers.\n\nThese checks are normally managed
            in a recruitment system.\n\nIf the employee has completed digital identity
            verification via Digital Staff Passport, this information can be used
            to support the DBS check.\n\nHence this API standard supports Digital
            Staff Passport sending DBS check supporting information to a recruitment
            system.\n\n## Status\nThis API standard is a [draft](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses),\nmeaning
            it is under development and might be subject to breaking changes.\n\n##
            Service level\nYour API must be a bronze service, meaning it is operational
            and supported during business hours.\n\nFor more details, see [service
            levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).\n\n##
            Technology\nThis API standard is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).\n\nIt
            does not conform to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir)\nglobal
            standard for health care data exchance because it is not a clinical API,
            it relates to workforce.\nThis has been agreed with the [HL7 FHIR UK Board](https://www.hl7.org.uk/register/about-hl7-uk/management-board-members/).\n\n##
            Network access\nYour API must be available on the internet.\n\n## Security
            and authorisation\nYour API must use OAuth 2.0 ''private key JWT'' to
            authenticate and authorise Digital Staff Passport as the calling system.\n\nFor
            more details, see [Authorisation using OAuth 2.0 private key JWT](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/authorisation-using-oauth-2.0-private-key-jwt).\n\n##
            Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request
            succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if it
            succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs
            to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client
            error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error
            on our server\n\nAlthough this is not a FHIR API, errors are returned
            as FHIR [OperationOutcome](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operationoutcome.html)
            resources, in line with our API design guidance.\n\nFor details of specific
            errors, see the ''Response'' section for each operation. See our [reference
            guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes)
            for more on errors.\n\n## Environments and testing\nYou''ll need to provide
            the following environments:\n\n| Environment | Suggested base URL |\n|---|---|\n|
            Integration test | `integration-test.<your domain>/dsp-api` |\n| Integration
            test | `<your domain>/dsp-api` |\n\n### Single versus multiple instance
            systems\nIf your system runs as a single instance supporting multiple
            employer organisations (sometimes called ''multiple tenant''), you should
            deploy it as per the suggested base URLs suggested above.\n\nIf you have
            a separate instance of your system per employer organisation, you should
            deploy each instance at the following base URL:\n\n`<your domain>/dsp-api/organisations/<org
            ODS code>`\n\nIn this case, you should alter the URL for the individual
            operations to exclude the `organisations/{org-id}` part, so that it isn''t
            repeated.\n\n### Integration testing\nYour integration test environment
            needs to include:\n- at least two organisations, so we can test cross-organisation
            security\n- sufficient test data to support a reasonable set of test scenarios
            - for example multiple people with the same surname or date of birth\n\n##
            Onboarding\nWe are currently running a pilot with one external system,
            so the API standard is not available for anyone else to onboard just yet.

            tools to check that the API is available and working.\n\nThe URL is `/organisations/{org-id}/_status`
            rather than just `/_status` so that it can be supported by systems that
            have separate instances deployed for each organisation.\n\nIt is based
            on the draft standard [Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-inadarei-api-health-check/).\n\nIt
            can be implemented as a ''shallow ping'' or a ''deep ping'':\n- For a
            shallow ping, the operation returns a `status` of `pass` without checking
            any dependent resources. This is the easier approach.\n- For a deep ping,
            the operation checks the status of dependent resources and returns a status
            that reflects the overall health of the service. The status of dependent
            resources is provided within the `checks` object. This approach is more
            work but allows us to react to live incidents more quickly.\n\nThe operation
            always returns an HTTP status code of 200, even if one or more of the
            dependent resources is not healthy.\nTherefore it is important for monitoring
            tools to check the `status` field in the body of the response.\n\nAll
            fields apart from `status` are optional, so the simplest possible implementation
            is a ''shallow ping'' response that always returns a single field `status`

            API","description":"## Overview\nUse this API standard to build an API
            that [Digital Staff Passport (DSP)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport)
            can use to interact with your system.\n\nThe standard currently supports
            the following use cases:\n\n| Use case                              |
            External system type       |\n| -------------------------------------
            | -------------------------- |\n| Get core skills                       |
            Learning management system |\n| Send core skills                      |
            Learning management system |\n| Send right to work information        |
            Recruitment system         |\n| Send DBS check supporting information
            | Recruitment system         |\n\nFor more context, see [Integrating with
            the Digital Staf Passport](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration),
            specifically:\n- [integration pattern 2](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration#pattern-2-outbound-via-online-portal)\n-
            [integration pattern 4](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration#pattern-4-inbound-via-online-portal)\n\n##
            Who can use this API standard\nYou can only use this API standard if you
            are integrating your system with Digital Staff Passport.\n\n## How this
            API standard works\nDSP needs to interact with a variety of external systems,
            to send and receive a variety of information.\nThis API standard provides
            a common approach regardless of the type of external system, as explained
            below.\n\n### Employee linking\nBefore DSP can exchange information with
            an external system, it needs to ''link'' the employee record using the
            external systems''s unique identifier for that employee.\n\nThere are
            two ways DSP can do this:\n- if the DSP user knows the employee''s external
            system ID, DSP can use the [Get employee personal details](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-)
            operation to allow the user to check it''s the right ID\n- if the DSP
            user doesn''t know the employee''s external system ID, DSP can use the
            [Search for an employee](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees) operation
            to find the ID based on employee details such as name and date of birth\n\n###
            Getting employee information\nGiven the employee''s external system ID,
            DSP can get information from the external system using the [Get employee
            records](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-/records)
            operation.\n\nThe type of information returned depends on the type of
            system. For example, a learning management system would return core skills
            records.\n\n### Sending employee information\nGiven the employee''s external
            system ID, DSP can send information to the external system using the [Add
            an employee record](#post-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-/records)
            operation.\n\nThe type of information sent depends on the type of system.
            For example, DSP might send identity information to a recruitment system
            in order to support varioius employment checks.\n\n## Employee record
            types\n\n### Core skills\nCore skills are a specific type of mandatory
            training that are common across all NHS organisations,\nand are generally
            aligned with the [Core Skills Training Framework (CSTF)](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/core-skills-training-framework/).\n\nCore
            skills are not always part of the CSTF.\nFor example, at the time of writing,
            Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training on Learning Disability and Autism is
            not part of the CSTF but is in scope for Digital Staff Passport.\n\nAlso,
            the Employee Staff Record (ESR) system includes a number of competencies
            which are flagged as ''CSTF'' even though they are not part of the Core
            Skills Training Framework.\nThey generally represent skills that have
            a [nationally-defined framework](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/resources/category/capabilities-frameworks/)\nsuch
            as the [Dementia skills framework](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/resources/dementia-2015-updated-2018/).\n\nFor
            the avoidance of doubt, a full list of the core skills in scope for Digital
            Staff Passport is provided in the\n[Digital Staff Passport core skills
            scope and mappings spreadsheet](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/digital-staff-passport---core-skills-scope-and-mappings.xlsx).\n\nCore
            skills records are typically held in a learning managements system (LMS).\nThis
            API standard supports:\n- DSP getting core skills from an LMS\n- DSP sending
            core skills to an LMS\n\nWhen sending and receiving core skills records,
            LMSs must follow the\n[standard naming conventions for CSTF core skills](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/images/services/cstf/CSTF%20Naming%20Conventions%20%20Competencies%20on%20ESR%20June%202019.pdf).\nTo
            help with this, mappings for the various data fields are included in the\n[Digital
            Staff Passport core skills scope and mappings spreadsheet](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/digital-staff-passport---core-skills-scope-and-mappings.xlsx).\n\nWhen
            receiving a core skill, LMSs should:\n- reject duplicates i.e. same competency
            name, same date last awarded\n- ignore the renewal period and expiry date,
            instead applying the local renewal period and re-calculating the expiry
            date\n\n### Right to work information\n[Right to work checks](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/right-work-checks-standard)
            must be performed by all NHS employers.\n\nThese checks are normally managed
            in a recruitment system.\n\nIf the employee has completed digital identity
            verification via Digital Staff Passport, this information can be used
            to support the right to work check.\n\nHence this API standard supports
            Digital Staff Passport sending right to work check information to a recruitment
            system.\n\n### DBS check supporting information\n[Criminal record (DBS)
            checks](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/criminal-record-checks-standard)
            must be performed by all NHS employers.\n\nThese checks are normally managed
            in a recruitment system.\n\nIf the employee has completed digital identity
            verification via Digital Staff Passport, this information can be used
            to support the DBS check.\n\nHence this API standard supports Digital
            Staff Passport sending DBS check supporting information to a recruitment
            system.\n\n## Status\nThis API standard is a [draft](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses),\nmeaning
            it is under development and might be subject to breaking changes.\n\n##
            Service level\nYour API must be a bronze service, meaning it is operational
            and supported during business hours.\n\nFor more details, see [service
            levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).\n\n##
            Technology\nThis API standard is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).\n\nIt
            does not conform to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir)\nglobal
            standard for health care data exchance because it is not a clinical API,
            it relates to workforce.\nThis has been agreed with the [HL7 FHIR UK Board](https://www.hl7.org.uk/register/about-hl7-uk/management-board-members/).\n\n##
            Network access\nYour API must be available on the internet.\n\n## Security
            and authorisation\nYour API must use OAuth 2.0 ''private key JWT'' to
            authenticate and authorise Digital Staff Passport as the calling system.\n\nFor
            more details, see [Authorisation using OAuth 2.0 private key JWT](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/authorisation-using-oauth-2.0-private-key-jwt).\n\n##
            Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request
            succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if it
            succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs
            to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client
            error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error
            on our server\n\nAlthough this is not a FHIR API, errors are returned
            as FHIR [OperationOutcome](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operationoutcome.html)
            resources, in line with our API design guidance.\n\nFor details of specific
            errors, see the ''Response'' section for each operation. See our [reference
            guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes)
            for more on errors.\n\n## Environments and testing\nYou''ll need to provide
            the following environments:\n\n| Environment | Suggested base URL |\n|---|---|\n|
            Integration test | `integration-test.<your domain>/dsp-api` |\n| Integration
            test | `<your domain>/dsp-api` |\n\n### Single versus multiple instance
            systems\nIf your system runs as a single instance supporting multiple
            employer organisations (sometimes called ''multiple tenant''), you should
            deploy it as per the suggested base URLs suggested above.\n\nIf you have
            a separate instance of your system per employer organisation, you should
            deploy each instance at the following base URL:\n\n`<your domain>/dsp-api/organisations/<org
            ODS code>`\n\nIn this case, you should alter the URL for the individual
            operations to exclude the `organisations/{org-id}` part, so that it isn''t
            repeated.\n\n### Integration testing\nYour integration test environment
            needs to include:\n- at least two organisations, so we can test cross-organisation
            security\n- sufficient test data to support a reasonable set of test scenarios
            - for example multiple people with the same surname or date of birth\n\n##
            Onboarding\nWe are currently running a pilot with one external system,
            so the API standard is not available for anyone else to onboard just yet.

            tools to check that the API is available and working.\n\nThe URL is `/organisations/{org-id}/_status`
            rather than just `/_status` so that it can be supported by systems that
            have separate instances deployed for each organisation.\n\nIt is based
            on the draft standard [Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-inadarei-api-health-check/).\n\nIt
            can be implemented as a ''shallow ping'' or a ''deep ping'':\n- For a
            shallow ping, the operation returns a `status` of `pass` without checking
            any dependent resources. This is the easier approach.\n- For a deep ping,
            the operation checks the status of dependent resources and returns a status
            that reflects the overall health of the service. The status of dependent
            resources is provided within the `checks` object. This approach is more
            work but allows us to react to live incidents more quickly.\n\nThe operation
            always returns an HTTP status code of 200, even if one or more of the
            dependent resources is not healthy.\nTherefore it is important for monitoring
            tools to check the `status` field in the body of the response.\n\nAll
            fields apart from `status` are optional, so the simplest possible implementation
            is a ''shallow ping'' response that always returns a single field `status`

            alongside our  [tutorials](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/tutorials)
            to teach yourself how to connect to our RESTful APIs.\nYou can:\n - get
            a response from an open-access endpoint, where the calling application
            and the end users are not authenticated\n - get a response from an application-restricted
            endpoint, where the calling application is authenticated but the end user
            is not authenticated\n - get a response from a user-restricted endpoint,
            where the calling application and the end user are authenticated\n \n
            For further details, see the ''Security and authorisation'' section below.\n\n##
            API status and roadmap\nThis API is for learning purposes only and is
            available in the sandbox environment.\nTo see our roadmap, or to suggest,
            comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product
            backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/107431/hello-world-api-and-tutorials).\nIf
            you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n\n##
            Technology\nThis API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest-apis).\n\n##
            Network access\nThis API is available on the internet and, indirectly,
            on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).\nTo
            use this API with NHS [smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards)
            (see below) you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives
            are available.\nFor more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\n\n##
            Security and authorisation\nThis API demonstrates the different authentication
            methods used in our APIs.\n\n### Open-access authentication \nUse the
            hello world endpoint to get a response from an open-access API. Some of
            our APIs are [open-access](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#open-access-apis),
            which means:\n - we do not authenticate or authorise the calling application\n
            - we do not authenticate or authorise the end user - they might not even
            be present\nWe generally use open-access APIs for public data, where security
            is not a concern.\nOur open-access APIs are generally RESTful APIs. For
            more details on how to access them, see our [open-access REST API tutorial](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/tutorials/open-access-rest-api-tutorial).\n\n###
            Application-restricted authentication \nUse the hello application endpoint
            to get a response from an application-restricted API. This access mode
            is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis),
            meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.\nYou
            can use this access mode as follows:\n - attended (end user present) -
            in which case, you must ensure the end user is authenticated and suitably
            authorised locally by the calling application\nTo use this access mode,
            use the following security pattern:\n - [Application-restricted RESTful
            APIs - API key authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-api-key-authentication)\n\n###
            User-restricted authentication\nUse the hello user endpoint to get a response
            from a user-restricted API. Some of our APIs are [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
            which means:\n - we authenticate and authorise the calling application\n
            - we authenticate, but do not authorise, the end user\nAlthough we do
            not authorise the end user, we do generally require the calling application
            to do it locally.\nWe only support authentication of healthcare workers.\n\n##

            Sandbox testing\nThis API is for learning purposes and is only available
            in our sandbox environment. Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):\n  -
            is for early developer testing\n  - only covers a limited set of scenarios\n  -
            is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates\n\n For more
            details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our \\\"Try
            this API\\\" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.\nAlternatively,
            you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/426d37cb9cfe17b8b96d)\n",

            API status and roadmap\nThis API is for learning purposes only and is
            available in the sandbox environment.\nTo see our roadmap, or to suggest,
            comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product
            backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/107431/hello-world-api-and-tutorials).\nIf
            you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n\n##
            Technology\nThis API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest-apis).\n\n##
            Network access\nThis API is available on the internet and, indirectly,
            on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).\nTo
            use this API with NHS [smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards)
            (see below) you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives
            are available.\nFor more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\n\n##
            Security and authorisation\nThis API demonstrates the different authentication
            methods used in our APIs.\n\n### Open-access authentication \nUse the
            hello world endpoint to get a response from an open-access API. Some of
            our APIs are [open-access](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#open-access-apis),
            which means:\n - we do not authenticate or authorise the calling application\n
            - we do not authenticate or authorise the end user - they might not even
            be present\nWe generally use open-access APIs for public data, where security
            is not a concern.\nOur open-access APIs are generally RESTful APIs. For
            more details on how to access them, see our [open-access REST API tutorial](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/tutorials/open-access-rest-api-tutorial).\n\n###
            Application-restricted authentication \nUse the hello application endpoint
            to get a response from an application-restricted API. This access mode
            is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis),
            meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.\nYou
            can use this access mode as follows:\n - attended (end user present) -
            in which case, you must ensure the end user is authenticated and suitably
            authorised locally by the calling application\nTo use this access mode,
            use the following security pattern:\n - [Application-restricted RESTful
            APIs - API key authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-api-key-authentication)\n\n###
            User-restricted authentication\nUse the hello user endpoint to get a response
            from a user-restricted API. Some of our APIs are [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
            which means:\n - we authenticate and authorise the calling application\n
            - we authenticate, but do not authorise, the end user\nAlthough we do
            not authorise the end user, we do generally require the calling application
            to do it locally.\nWe only support authentication of healthcare workers.\n\n##

            Sandbox testing\nThis API is for learning purposes and is only available
            in our sandbox environment. Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):\n  -
            is for early developer testing\n  - only covers a limited set of scenarios\n  -
