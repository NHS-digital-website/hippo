                <p>Use this API to access the Access Control Service (ACS) - which manages consent to share patient information, including their SCR.</p>

                <p>GP systems must check consent to share before sharing, for example, a patient's Summary Care Record (SCR).</p>

                <p>You can:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>get the access permissions for a patient's documents, including their SCR</li>
                 <li>set access permissions on a patient's documents, including their SCR</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Note the <a href="content">Summary Care Record - FHIR API</a>&nbsp;also has endpoints enabling you to get and set access permissions<em>,</em>&nbsp;the same as this&nbsp;ACS API.</p>

                <h3>Authentication</h3>

                <p>This API is user-restricted, meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.</p>

                <p>The end user must be:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>a healthcare worker</li>
                 <li>strongly authenticated, using either an NHS <a href="content">smartcard </a>or a <a href="content_1">modern alternative</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>We support the following security patterns:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>user-restricted HL7 V3 API, using NHS Care Identity Service 2 (NHS CIS2)</li>
                 <li>user-restricted HL7 V3 API, using CIS</li>

                <h3>Authorisation</h3>

                <p>For some activities, the end user must be authorised to perform that activity.</p>

                <p>The API itself does not perform any authorisation checks. Rather, the calling system is expected to perform them. The authorisation rules are specified in our national Role Based Access Control (RBAC) database.</p>

                 <li>set access permissions on a patient's documents, including their SCR</li>

                <h3>Authentication</h3>

                <p>This API is user-restricted, meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.</p>

                <p>The end user must be:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>a healthcare worker</li>
                 <li>strongly authenticated, using either an NHS <a href="content">smartcard </a>or a <a href="content_1">modern alternative</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>We support the following security patterns:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>user-restricted HL7 V3 API, using NHS Care Identity Service 2 (NHS CIS2)</li>

                <h3>Authorisation</h3>

                <p>For some activities, the end user must be authorised to perform that activity.</p>

                <p>The API itself does not perform any authorisation checks. Rather, the calling system is expected to perform them. The authorisation rules are specified in our national Role Based Access Control (RBAC) database.</p>

                <h3>Authorisation</h3>

                <p>For some activities, the end user must be authorised to perform that activity.</p>

                <p>The API itself does not perform any authorisation checks. Rather, the calling system is expected to perform them. The authorisation rules are specified in our national Role Based Access Control (RBAC) database.</p>

                <p>For more details see our <a href="registration-authority-key-documents-and-forms">national Role Based Access Control (RBAC) database</a>.</p>

            Signature Service API","version":"{VERSION}","contact":{"name":"Digital
            Signature Service API","url":"https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support","email":"api.management@nhs.net"},"description":"##
            Overview\nUse this Digital Signature Service API to digitally sign one
            or more prescriptions from an application with a CIS2 Authentication session.
            There are various CIS2 Authentication mechanisms, with the choice made
            separately for each request.\n\nThe current authenticators available with
            the Signing Gateway API include:\n* Windows Hello for Business \n* Security
            keys\n* iPad authentication via IOS CIS2 app\n* NHS Smartcards \n\nYou
            cannot use this API to produce signatures using:  \n* Virtual Smartcards
            \n* Microsoft Authenticator \n\nA healthcare worker must be present and
            authenticated with an [NHS CIS2 authenticator](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/care-identity-service/applications-and-services/cis2-authentication#authenticator-options)
            to use this API.\n\n## Using this API\nUse this API for browser based
            and native applications.\n\nTo use this API, you must: \n1. create an
            RSA key pair with a key length of 4096 bits or greater  \n2. [contact
            us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support)\n\nWhen you contact
            us you must provide:\n   * your public key, which we store in our JSON
            Web Key Set (JWKS) and give you a Key ID\n   * a callback URL which our
            service can use to notify your system when the signing process is complete\n\nTo
            generate signatures you should:\n1. make a request to the POST /$prepare
            endpoint of the [Electronic Prescription Service - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir)
            and save the response, for each prescription to be signed \n2. create
            a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the Key ID and the data to be signed
            (see [signature-request](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir#api-description__endpoint-overview)
            for more information) \n3. sign the JWT with the RS256 or RS512 algorithm
            using your private key \n4. send the JWT to the Digital Signature Service
            using the POST /signaturerequest endpoint. The service responds with a
            token representing your signature request and a redirect URL.  \n5. expect
            the user experience to vary at this point, based on the authentication
            mechanism used \n6. send the token received by the callback URL to the
            GET /signatureresponse endpoint to obtain the signatures \n\n## Who can
            use this API\nThis API can only be used where there is a legal basis to
            do so. Make sure you have a [valid use case](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/enabling-eps-for-your-service)
            before you complete your development. You must do this before you can
            go live.\n\n## Related APIs\nThe following APIs are related to the Digital
            Signature Service API:\n* [Electronic Prescription Service (FHIR) API](https://portal.developer.nhs.uk/docs/electronic-prescription-service-api-prod/1/overview)
            - use this API if you want to send prescriptions electronically once they
            are signed with the via the Digital Signature Service API.\n\n## API status
            and roadmap\nThis API is [in production, beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).
            If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n\n##
            Technology\nThis API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).\n\nEnd
            users of the API require NHS Credential Management to be installed and
            running on their local machine for signing by smartcard to be successful.  \n\n##
            Network access\nThis API is available on the internet.\n\n## Security
            and authorisation\nThis API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),\nmeaning
            an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.\n\nThe end user
            must be:\n* a healthcare professional\n* strongly authenticated using
            one of the approved CIS2 Authentication methods\n\nThe API uses Open ID
            Connect to authenticate the end user and OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling
            system. It supports the separate authentication and authorisation security
            pattern using the user-restricted RESTful API with NHS Care Identity Service
            2 (NHS CIS2) Authentication and authorisation.  \n\n## Environments and

            is for early developer testing\n* only covers a limited set of scenarios\n*
            is stateless, so it does not store data\n* is open access, so does not
            allow you to test authorisation\n\nFor more details on sandbox testing,
            or to try out the sandbox using our \"Try this API\" feature, see the
            documentation for each endpoint.\n\n### Integration testing\nOur [integration
            test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):\n*
            is for formal integration testing\n* is stateful, so it does persist data\n*
            includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards)
            and non-smartcard options\n\nFor more details see [integration testing
            with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).\n\n##
            Onboarding\nThis API can only be used for Signature creation with the
            [Electronic Prescription Service FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir).
            Make sure you have a [valid use case](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/enabling-eps-for-your-service)
            before you complete your development.\n\nYou will have to complete onboarding
            with CIS2 Authentication first, and your use of this API in production
            will be granted with EPS.  \n\nLearn more about developing with CIS2 Authentication
            by reading our [onboarding documentation](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/care-identity-service/applications-and-services/cis2-authentication/guidance-for-developers/detailed-guidance/authorization-code-flow).  \n\n##
            Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request
            succeeded or not.\n\nThey are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if
            it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs
            to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client
            error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error
            on our server\nErrors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints
            section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#errors)

            Overview\nUse this Digital Signature Service API to digitally sign one
            or more prescriptions from an application with a CIS2 Authentication session.
            There are various CIS2 Authentication mechanisms, with the choice made
            separately for each request.\n\nThe current authenticators available with
            the Signing Gateway API include:\n* Windows Hello for Business \n* Security
            keys\n* iPad authentication via IOS CIS2 app\n* NHS Smartcards \n\nYou
            cannot use this API to produce signatures using:  \n* Virtual Smartcards
            \n* Microsoft Authenticator \n\nA healthcare worker must be present and
            authenticated with an [NHS CIS2 authenticator](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/care-identity-service/applications-and-services/cis2-authentication#authenticator-options)
            to use this API.\n\n## Using this API\nUse this API for browser based
            and native applications.\n\nTo use this API, you must: \n1. create an
            RSA key pair with a key length of 4096 bits or greater  \n2. [contact
            us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support)\n\nWhen you contact
            us you must provide:\n   * your public key, which we store in our JSON
            Web Key Set (JWKS) and give you a Key ID\n   * a callback URL which our
            service can use to notify your system when the signing process is complete\n\nTo
            generate signatures you should:\n1. make a request to the POST /$prepare
            endpoint of the [Electronic Prescription Service - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir)
            and save the response, for each prescription to be signed \n2. create
            a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the Key ID and the data to be signed
            (see [signature-request](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir#api-description__endpoint-overview)
            for more information) \n3. sign the JWT with the RS256 or RS512 algorithm
            using your private key \n4. send the JWT to the Digital Signature Service
            using the POST /signaturerequest endpoint. The service responds with a
            token representing your signature request and a redirect URL.  \n5. expect
            the user experience to vary at this point, based on the authentication
            mechanism used \n6. send the token received by the callback URL to the
            GET /signatureresponse endpoint to obtain the signatures \n\n## Who can
            use this API\nThis API can only be used where there is a legal basis to
            do so. Make sure you have a [valid use case](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/enabling-eps-for-your-service)
            before you complete your development. You must do this before you can
            go live.\n\n## Related APIs\nThe following APIs are related to the Digital
            Signature Service API:\n* [Electronic Prescription Service (FHIR) API](https://portal.developer.nhs.uk/docs/electronic-prescription-service-api-prod/1/overview)
            - use this API if you want to send prescriptions electronically once they
            are signed with the via the Digital Signature Service API.\n\n## API status
            and roadmap\nThis API is [in production, beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).
            If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n\n##
            Technology\nThis API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).\n\nEnd
            users of the API require NHS Credential Management to be installed and
            running on their local machine for signing by smartcard to be successful.  \n\n##
            Network access\nThis API is available on the internet.\n\n## Security
            and authorisation\nThis API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),\nmeaning
            an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.\n\nThe end user
            must be:\n* a healthcare professional\n* strongly authenticated using
            one of the approved CIS2 Authentication methods\n\nThe API uses Open ID
            Connect to authenticate the end user and OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling
            system. It supports the separate authentication and authorisation security
            pattern using the user-restricted RESTful API with NHS Care Identity Service
            2 (NHS CIS2) Authentication and authorisation.  \n\n## Environments and
            testing\n\n| Purpose                                     | URL                                                                  |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

            [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):\n*
            is for early developer testing\n* only covers a limited set of scenarios\n*
            is stateless, so it does not store data\n* is open access, so does not
            allow you to test authorisation\n\nFor more details on sandbox testing,
            or to try out the sandbox using our \"Try this API\" feature, see the
            documentation for each endpoint.\n\n### Integration testing\nOur [integration
            test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):\n*
            is for formal integration testing\n* is stateful, so it does persist data\n*
            includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards)
            and non-smartcard options\n\nFor more details see [integration testing
            with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).\n\n##
            Onboarding\nThis API can only be used for Signature creation with the
            [Electronic Prescription Service FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir).
            Make sure you have a [valid use case](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/enabling-eps-for-your-service)
            before you complete your development.\n\nYou will have to complete onboarding
            with CIS2 Authentication first, and your use of this API in production
            will be granted with EPS.  \n\nLearn more about developing with CIS2 Authentication
            by reading our [onboarding documentation](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/care-identity-service/applications-and-services/cis2-authentication/guidance-for-developers/detailed-guidance/authorization-code-flow).  \n\n##
            Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request
            succeeded or not.\n\nThey are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if
            it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs
            to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client
            error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error
            on our server\nErrors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints
            section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#errors)
            for more on errors.\n"},"servers":[{"url":"https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/signing-service","description":"Sandbox"},{"url":"https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/signing-service","description":"Integration

            Overview\nUse this Digital Signature Service API to digitally sign one
            or more prescriptions from an application with a CIS2 Authentication session.
            There are various CIS2 Authentication mechanisms, with the choice made
            separately for each request.\n\nThe current authenticators available with
            the Signing Gateway API include:\n* Windows Hello for Business \n* Security
            keys\n* iPad authentication via IOS CIS2 app\n* NHS Smartcards \n\nYou
            cannot use this API to produce signatures using:  \n* Virtual Smartcards
            \n* Microsoft Authenticator \n\nA healthcare worker must be present and
            authenticated with an [NHS CIS2 authenticator](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/care-identity-service/applications-and-services/cis2-authentication#authenticator-options)
            to use this API.\n\n## Using this API\nUse this API for browser based
            and native applications.\n\nTo use this API, you must: \n1. create an
            RSA key pair with a key length of 4096 bits or greater  \n2. [contact
            us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support)\n\nWhen you contact
            us you must provide:\n   * your public key, which we store in our JSON
            Web Key Set (JWKS) and give you a Key ID\n   * a callback URL which our
            service can use to notify your system when the signing process is complete\n\nTo
            generate signatures you should:\n1. make a request to the POST /$prepare
            endpoint of the [Electronic Prescription Service - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir)
            and save the response, for each prescription to be signed \n2. create
            a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the Key ID and the data to be signed
            (see [signature-request](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir#api-description__endpoint-overview)
            for more information) \n3. sign the JWT with the RS256 or RS512 algorithm
            using your private key \n4. send the JWT to the Digital Signature Service
            using the POST /signaturerequest endpoint. The service responds with a
            token representing your signature request and a redirect URL.  \n5. expect
            the user experience to vary at this point, based on the authentication
            mechanism used \n6. send the token received by the callback URL to the
            GET /signatureresponse endpoint to obtain the signatures \n\n## Who can
            use this API\nThis API can only be used where there is a legal basis to
            do so. Make sure you have a [valid use case](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/enabling-eps-for-your-service)
            before you complete your development. You must do this before you can
            go live.\n\n## Related APIs\nThe following APIs are related to the Digital
            Signature Service API:\n* [Electronic Prescription Service (FHIR) API](https://portal.developer.nhs.uk/docs/electronic-prescription-service-api-prod/1/overview)
            - use this API if you want to send prescriptions electronically once they
            are signed with the via the Digital Signature Service API.\n\n## API status
            and roadmap\nThis API is [in production, beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).
            If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n\n##
            Technology\nThis API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).\n\nEnd
            users of the API require NHS Credential Management to be installed and
            running on their local machine for signing by smartcard to be successful.  \n\n##
            Network access\nThis API is available on the internet.\n\n## Security
            and authorisation\nThis API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),\nmeaning
            an end user must be present and authenticated to use it.\n\nThe end user
            must be:\n* a healthcare professional\n* strongly authenticated using
            one of the approved CIS2 Authentication methods\n\nThe API uses Open ID
            Connect to authenticate the end user and OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling
            system. It supports the separate authentication and authorisation security
            pattern using the user-restricted RESTful API with NHS Care Identity Service
            2 (NHS CIS2) Authentication and authorisation.  \n\n## Environments and

            is for early developer testing\n* only covers a limited set of scenarios\n*
            is stateless, so it does not store data\n* is open access, so does not
            allow you to test authorisation\n\nFor more details on sandbox testing,
            or to try out the sandbox using our \"Try this API\" feature, see the
            documentation for each endpoint.\n\n### Integration testing\nOur [integration
            test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):\n*
            is for formal integration testing\n* is stateful, so it does persist data\n*
            includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards)
            and non-smartcard options\n\nFor more details see [integration testing
            with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).\n\n##
            Onboarding\nThis API can only be used for Signature creation with the
            [Electronic Prescription Service FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir).
            Make sure you have a [valid use case](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/enabling-eps-for-your-service)
            before you complete your development.\n\nYou will have to complete onboarding
            with CIS2 Authentication first, and your use of this API in production
            will be granted with EPS.  \n\nLearn more about developing with CIS2 Authentication
            by reading our [onboarding documentation](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/care-identity-service/applications-and-services/cis2-authentication/guidance-for-developers/detailed-guidance/authorization-code-flow).  \n\n##
            Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request
            succeeded or not.\n\nThey are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if
            it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs
            to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client
            error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error
            on our server\nErrors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints
            section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#errors)

            API","description":"## Overview\nUse this API standard to build an API
            that [Digital Staff Passport (DSP)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport)
            can use to interact with your system.\n\nThe standard currently supports
            the following use cases:\n\n| Use case                              |
            External system type       |\n| -------------------------------------
            | -------------------------- |\n| Get core skills                       |
            Learning management system |\n| Send core skills                      |
            Learning management system |\n| Send right to work information        |
            Recruitment system         |\n| Send DBS check supporting information
            | Recruitment system         |\n\nFor more context, see [Integrating with
            the Digital Staf Passport](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration),
            specifically:\n- [integration pattern 2](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration#pattern-2-outbound-via-online-portal)\n-
            [integration pattern 4](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration#pattern-4-inbound-via-online-portal)\n\n##
            Who can use this API standard\nYou can only use this API standard if you
            are integrating your system with Digital Staff Passport.\n\n## How this
            API standard works\nDSP needs to interact with a variety of external systems,
            to send and receive a variety of information.\nThis API standard provides
            a common approach regardless of the type of external system, as explained
            below.\n\n### Employee linking\nBefore DSP can exchange information with
            an external system, it needs to ''link'' the employee record using the
            external systems''s unique identifier for that employee.\n\nThere are
            two ways DSP can do this:\n- if the DSP user knows the employee''s external
            system ID, DSP can use the [Get employee personal details](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-)
            operation to allow the user to check it''s the right ID\n- if the DSP
            user doesn''t know the employee''s external system ID, DSP can use the
            [Search for an employee](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees) operation
            to find the ID based on employee details such as name and date of birth\n\n###
            Getting employee information\nGiven the employee''s external system ID,
            DSP can get information from the external system using the [Get employee
            records](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-/records)
            operation.\n\nThe type of information returned depends on the type of
            system. For example, a learning management system would return core skills
            records.\n\n### Sending employee information\nGiven the employee''s external
            system ID, DSP can send information to the external system using the [Add
            an employee record](#post-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-/records)
            operation.\n\nThe type of information sent depends on the type of system.
            For example, DSP might send identity information to a recruitment system
            in order to support varioius employment checks.\n\n## Employee record
            types\n\n### Core skills\nCore skills are a specific type of mandatory
            training that are common across all NHS organisations,\nand are generally
            aligned with the [Core Skills Training Framework (CSTF)](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/core-skills-training-framework/).\n\nCore
            skills are not always part of the CSTF.\nFor example, at the time of writing,
            Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training on Learning Disability and Autism is
            not part of the CSTF but is in scope for Digital Staff Passport.\n\nAlso,
            the Employee Staff Record (ESR) system includes a number of competencies
            which are flagged as ''CSTF'' even though they are not part of the Core
            Skills Training Framework.\nThey generally represent skills that have
            a [nationally-defined framework](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/resources/category/capabilities-frameworks/)\nsuch
            as the [Dementia skills framework](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/resources/dementia-2015-updated-2018/).\n\nFor
            the avoidance of doubt, a full list of the core skills in scope for Digital
            Staff Passport is provided in the\n[Digital Staff Passport core skills
            scope and mappings spreadsheet](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/digital-staff-passport---core-skills-scope-and-mappings.xlsx).\n\nCore
            skills records are typically held in a learning managements system (LMS).\nThis
            API standard supports:\n- DSP getting core skills from an LMS\n- DSP sending
            core skills to an LMS\n\nWhen sending and receiving core skills records,
            LMSs must follow the\n[standard naming conventions for CSTF core skills](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/images/services/cstf/CSTF%20Naming%20Conventions%20%20Competencies%20on%20ESR%20June%202019.pdf).\nTo
            help with this, mappings for the various data fields are included in the\n[Digital
            Staff Passport core skills scope and mappings spreadsheet](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/digital-staff-passport---core-skills-scope-and-mappings.xlsx).\n\nWhen
            receiving a core skill, LMSs should:\n- reject duplicates i.e. same competency
            name, same date last awarded\n- ignore the renewal period and expiry date,
            instead applying the local renewal period and re-calculating the expiry
            date\n\n### Right to work information\n[Right to work checks](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/right-work-checks-standard)
            must be performed by all NHS employers.\n\nThese checks are normally managed
            in a recruitment system.\n\nIf the employee has completed digital identity
            verification via Digital Staff Passport, this information can be used
            to support the right to work check.\n\nHence this API standard supports
            Digital Staff Passport sending right to work check information to a recruitment
            system.\n\n### DBS check supporting information\n[Criminal record (DBS)
            checks](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/criminal-record-checks-standard)
            must be performed by all NHS employers.\n\nThese checks are normally managed
            in a recruitment system.\n\nIf the employee has completed digital identity
            verification via Digital Staff Passport, this information can be used
            to support the DBS check.\n\nHence this API standard supports Digital
            Staff Passport sending DBS check supporting information to a recruitment
            system.\n\n## Status\nThis API standard is a [draft](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses),\nmeaning
            it is under development and might be subject to breaking changes.\n\n##
            Service level\nYour API must be a bronze service, meaning it is operational
            and supported during business hours.\n\nFor more details, see [service
            levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).\n\n##
            Technology\nThis API standard is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).\n\nIt
            does not conform to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir)\nglobal
            standard for health care data exchance because it is not a clinical API,
            it relates to workforce.\nThis has been agreed with the [HL7 FHIR UK Board](https://www.hl7.org.uk/register/about-hl7-uk/management-board-members/).\n\n##
            Network access\nYour API must be available on the internet.\n\n## Security
            and authorisation\nYour API must use OAuth 2.0 ''private key JWT'' to
            authenticate and authorise Digital Staff Passport as the calling system.\n\nFor
            more details, see [Authorisation using OAuth 2.0 private key JWT](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/authorisation-using-oauth-2.0-private-key-jwt).\n\n##
            Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request
            succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if it
            succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs
            to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client
            error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error
            on our server\n\nAlthough this is not a FHIR API, errors are returned
            as FHIR [OperationOutcome](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operationoutcome.html)
            resources, in line with our API design guidance.\n\nFor details of specific
            errors, see the ''Response'' section for each operation. See our [reference
            guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes)
            for more on errors.\n\n## Environments and testing\nYou''ll need to provide
            the following environments:\n\n| Environment | Suggested base URL |\n|---|---|\n|
            Integration test | `integration-test.<your domain>/dsp-api` |\n| Integration
            test | `<your domain>/dsp-api` |\n\n### Single versus multiple instance
            systems\nIf your system runs as a single instance supporting multiple
            employer organisations (sometimes called ''multiple tenant''), you should
            deploy it as per the suggested base URLs suggested above.\n\nIf you have
            a separate instance of your system per employer organisation, you should
            deploy each instance at the following base URL:\n\n`<your domain>/dsp-api/organisations/<org
            ODS code>`\n\nIn this case, you should alter the URL for the individual
            operations to exclude the `organisations/{org-id}` part, so that it isn''t
            repeated.\n\n### Integration testing\nYour integration test environment
            needs to include:\n- at least two organisations, so we can test cross-organisation
            security\n- sufficient test data to support a reasonable set of test scenarios
            - for example multiple people with the same surname or date of birth\n\n##
            Onboarding\nWe are currently running a pilot with one external system,
            so the API standard is not available for anyone else to onboard just yet.

            tools to check that the API is available and working.\n\nThe URL is `/organisations/{org-id}/_status`
            rather than just `/_status` so that it can be supported by systems that
            have separate instances deployed for each organisation.\n\nIt is based
            on the draft standard [Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-inadarei-api-health-check/).\n\nIt
            can be implemented as a ''shallow ping'' or a ''deep ping'':\n- For a
            shallow ping, the operation returns a `status` of `pass` without checking
            any dependent resources. This is the easier approach.\n- For a deep ping,
            the operation checks the status of dependent resources and returns a status
            that reflects the overall health of the service. The status of dependent
            resources is provided within the `checks` object. This approach is more
            work but allows us to react to live incidents more quickly.\n\nThe operation
            always returns an HTTP status code of 200, even if one or more of the
            dependent resources is not healthy.\nTherefore it is important for monitoring
            tools to check the `status` field in the body of the response.\n\nAll
            fields apart from `status` are optional, so the simplest possible implementation
            is a ''shallow ping'' response that always returns a single field `status`

            API","description":"## Overview\nUse this API standard to build an API
            that [Digital Staff Passport (DSP)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport)
            can use to interact with your system.\n\nThe standard currently supports
            the following use cases:\n\n| Use case                              |
            External system type       |\n| -------------------------------------
            | -------------------------- |\n| Get core skills                       |
            Learning management system |\n| Send core skills                      |
            Learning management system |\n| Send right to work information        |
            Recruitment system         |\n| Send DBS check supporting information
            | Recruitment system         |\n\nFor more context, see [Integrating with
            the Digital Staf Passport](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration),
            specifically:\n- [integration pattern 2](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration#pattern-2-outbound-via-online-portal)\n-
            [integration pattern 4](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration#pattern-4-inbound-via-online-portal)\n\n##
            Who can use this API standard\nYou can only use this API standard if you
            are integrating your system with Digital Staff Passport.\n\n## How this
            API standard works\nDSP needs to interact with a variety of external systems,
            to send and receive a variety of information.\nThis API standard provides
            a common approach regardless of the type of external system, as explained
            below.\n\n### Employee linking\nBefore DSP can exchange information with
            an external system, it needs to ''link'' the employee record using the
            external systems''s unique identifier for that employee.\n\nThere are
            two ways DSP can do this:\n- if the DSP user knows the employee''s external
            system ID, DSP can use the [Get employee personal details](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-)
            operation to allow the user to check it''s the right ID\n- if the DSP
            user doesn''t know the employee''s external system ID, DSP can use the
            [Search for an employee](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees) operation
            to find the ID based on employee details such as name and date of birth\n\n###
            Getting employee information\nGiven the employee''s external system ID,
            DSP can get information from the external system using the [Get employee
            records](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-/records)
            operation.\n\nThe type of information returned depends on the type of
            system. For example, a learning management system would return core skills
            records.\n\n### Sending employee information\nGiven the employee''s external
            system ID, DSP can send information to the external system using the [Add
            an employee record](#post-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-/records)
            operation.\n\nThe type of information sent depends on the type of system.
            For example, DSP might send identity information to a recruitment system
            in order to support varioius employment checks.\n\n## Employee record
            types\n\n### Core skills\nCore skills are a specific type of mandatory
            training that are common across all NHS organisations,\nand are generally
            aligned with the [Core Skills Training Framework (CSTF)](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/core-skills-training-framework/).\n\nCore
            skills are not always part of the CSTF.\nFor example, at the time of writing,
            Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training on Learning Disability and Autism is
            not part of the CSTF but is in scope for Digital Staff Passport.\n\nAlso,
            the Employee Staff Record (ESR) system includes a number of competencies
            which are flagged as ''CSTF'' even though they are not part of the Core
            Skills Training Framework.\nThey generally represent skills that have
            a [nationally-defined framework](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/resources/category/capabilities-frameworks/)\nsuch
            as the [Dementia skills framework](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/resources/dementia-2015-updated-2018/).\n\nFor
            the avoidance of doubt, a full list of the core skills in scope for Digital
            Staff Passport is provided in the\n[Digital Staff Passport core skills
            scope and mappings spreadsheet](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/digital-staff-passport---core-skills-scope-and-mappings.xlsx).\n\nCore
            skills records are typically held in a learning managements system (LMS).\nThis
            API standard supports:\n- DSP getting core skills from an LMS\n- DSP sending
            core skills to an LMS\n\nWhen sending and receiving core skills records,
            LMSs must follow the\n[standard naming conventions for CSTF core skills](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/images/services/cstf/CSTF%20Naming%20Conventions%20%20Competencies%20on%20ESR%20June%202019.pdf).\nTo
            help with this, mappings for the various data fields are included in the\n[Digital
            Staff Passport core skills scope and mappings spreadsheet](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/digital-staff-passport---core-skills-scope-and-mappings.xlsx).\n\nWhen
            receiving a core skill, LMSs should:\n- reject duplicates i.e. same competency
            name, same date last awarded\n- ignore the renewal period and expiry date,
            instead applying the local renewal period and re-calculating the expiry
            date\n\n### Right to work information\n[Right to work checks](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/right-work-checks-standard)
            must be performed by all NHS employers.\n\nThese checks are normally managed
            in a recruitment system.\n\nIf the employee has completed digital identity
            verification via Digital Staff Passport, this information can be used
            to support the right to work check.\n\nHence this API standard supports
            Digital Staff Passport sending right to work check information to a recruitment
            system.\n\n### DBS check supporting information\n[Criminal record (DBS)
            checks](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/criminal-record-checks-standard)
            must be performed by all NHS employers.\n\nThese checks are normally managed
            in a recruitment system.\n\nIf the employee has completed digital identity
            verification via Digital Staff Passport, this information can be used
            to support the DBS check.\n\nHence this API standard supports Digital
            Staff Passport sending DBS check supporting information to a recruitment
            system.\n\n## Status\nThis API standard is a [draft](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses),\nmeaning
            it is under development and might be subject to breaking changes.\n\n##
            Service level\nYour API must be a bronze service, meaning it is operational
            and supported during business hours.\n\nFor more details, see [service
            levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).\n\n##
            Technology\nThis API standard is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).\n\nIt
            does not conform to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir)\nglobal
            standard for health care data exchance because it is not a clinical API,
            it relates to workforce.\nThis has been agreed with the [HL7 FHIR UK Board](https://www.hl7.org.uk/register/about-hl7-uk/management-board-members/).\n\n##
            Network access\nYour API must be available on the internet.\n\n## Security
            and authorisation\nYour API must use OAuth 2.0 ''private key JWT'' to
            authenticate and authorise Digital Staff Passport as the calling system.\n\nFor
            more details, see [Authorisation using OAuth 2.0 private key JWT](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/authorisation-using-oauth-2.0-private-key-jwt).\n\n##
            Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request
            succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if it
            succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs
            to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client
            error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error
            on our server\n\nAlthough this is not a FHIR API, errors are returned
            as FHIR [OperationOutcome](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operationoutcome.html)
            resources, in line with our API design guidance.\n\nFor details of specific
            errors, see the ''Response'' section for each operation. See our [reference
            guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes)
            for more on errors.\n\n## Environments and testing\nYou''ll need to provide
            the following environments:\n\n| Environment | Suggested base URL |\n|---|---|\n|
            Integration test | `integration-test.<your domain>/dsp-api` |\n| Integration
            test | `<your domain>/dsp-api` |\n\n### Single versus multiple instance
            systems\nIf your system runs as a single instance supporting multiple
            employer organisations (sometimes called ''multiple tenant''), you should
            deploy it as per the suggested base URLs suggested above.\n\nIf you have
            a separate instance of your system per employer organisation, you should
            deploy each instance at the following base URL:\n\n`<your domain>/dsp-api/organisations/<org
            ODS code>`\n\nIn this case, you should alter the URL for the individual
            operations to exclude the `organisations/{org-id}` part, so that it isn''t
            repeated.\n\n### Integration testing\nYour integration test environment
            needs to include:\n- at least two organisations, so we can test cross-organisation
            security\n- sufficient test data to support a reasonable set of test scenarios
            - for example multiple people with the same surname or date of birth\n\n##
            Onboarding\nWe are currently running a pilot with one external system,
            so the API standard is not available for anyone else to onboard just yet.

            tools to check that the API is available and working.\n\nThe URL is `/organisations/{org-id}/_status`
            rather than just `/_status` so that it can be supported by systems that
            have separate instances deployed for each organisation.\n\nIt is based
            on the draft standard [Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-inadarei-api-health-check/).\n\nIt
            can be implemented as a ''shallow ping'' or a ''deep ping'':\n- For a
            shallow ping, the operation returns a `status` of `pass` without checking
            any dependent resources. This is the easier approach.\n- For a deep ping,
            the operation checks the status of dependent resources and returns a status
            that reflects the overall health of the service. The status of dependent
            resources is provided within the `checks` object. This approach is more
            work but allows us to react to live incidents more quickly.\n\nThe operation
            always returns an HTTP status code of 200, even if one or more of the
            dependent resources is not healthy.\nTherefore it is important for monitoring
            tools to check the `status` field in the body of the response.\n\nAll
            fields apart from `status` are optional, so the simplest possible implementation
            is a ''shallow ping'' response that always returns a single field `status`

            API","description":"## Overview\nUse this API standard to build an API
            that [Digital Staff Passport (DSP)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport)
            can use to interact with your system.\n\nThe standard currently supports
            the following use cases:\n\n| Use case                              |
            External system type       |\n| -------------------------------------
            | -------------------------- |\n| Get core skills                       |
            Learning management system |\n| Send core skills                      |
            Learning management system |\n| Send right to work information        |
            Recruitment system         |\n| Send DBS check supporting information
            | Recruitment system         |\n\nFor more context, see [Integrating with
            the Digital Staf Passport](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration),
            specifically:\n- [integration pattern 2](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration#pattern-2-outbound-via-online-portal)\n-
            [integration pattern 4](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/integration#pattern-4-inbound-via-online-portal)\n\n##
            Who can use this API standard\nYou can only use this API standard if you
            are integrating your system with Digital Staff Passport.\n\n## How this
            API standard works\nDSP needs to interact with a variety of external systems,
            to send and receive a variety of information.\nThis API standard provides
            a common approach regardless of the type of external system, as explained
            below.\n\n### Employee linking\nBefore DSP can exchange information with
            an external system, it needs to ''link'' the employee record using the
            external systems''s unique identifier for that employee.\n\nThere are
            two ways DSP can do this:\n- if the DSP user knows the employee''s external
            system ID, DSP can use the [Get employee personal details](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-)
            operation to allow the user to check it''s the right ID\n- if the DSP
            user doesn''t know the employee''s external system ID, DSP can use the
            [Search for an employee](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees) operation
            to find the ID based on employee details such as name and date of birth\n\n###
            Getting employee information\nGiven the employee''s external system ID,
            DSP can get information from the external system using the [Get employee
            records](#get-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-/records)
            operation.\n\nThe type of information returned depends on the type of
            system. For example, a learning management system would return core skills
            records.\n\n### Sending employee information\nGiven the employee''s external
            system ID, DSP can send information to the external system using the [Add
            an employee record](#post-/organisations/-org-id-/employees/-employee-id-/records)
            operation.\n\nThe type of information sent depends on the type of system.
            For example, DSP might send identity information to a recruitment system
            in order to support varioius employment checks.\n\n## Employee record
            types\n\n### Core skills\nCore skills are a specific type of mandatory
            training that are common across all NHS organisations,\nand are generally
            aligned with the [Core Skills Training Framework (CSTF)](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/core-skills-training-framework/).\n\nCore
            skills are not always part of the CSTF.\nFor example, at the time of writing,
            Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training on Learning Disability and Autism is
            not part of the CSTF but is in scope for Digital Staff Passport.\n\nAlso,
            the Employee Staff Record (ESR) system includes a number of competencies
            which are flagged as ''CSTF'' even though they are not part of the Core
            Skills Training Framework.\nThey generally represent skills that have
            a [nationally-defined framework](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/resources/category/capabilities-frameworks/)\nsuch
            as the [Dementia skills framework](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/resources/dementia-2015-updated-2018/).\n\nFor
            the avoidance of doubt, a full list of the core skills in scope for Digital
            Staff Passport is provided in the\n[Digital Staff Passport core skills
            scope and mappings spreadsheet](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/digital-staff-passport---core-skills-scope-and-mappings.xlsx).\n\nCore
            skills records are typically held in a learning managements system (LMS).\nThis
            API standard supports:\n- DSP getting core skills from an LMS\n- DSP sending
            core skills to an LMS\n\nWhen sending and receiving core skills records,
            LMSs must follow the\n[standard naming conventions for CSTF core skills](https://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/images/services/cstf/CSTF%20Naming%20Conventions%20%20Competencies%20on%20ESR%20June%202019.pdf).\nTo
            help with this, mappings for the various data fields are included in the\n[Digital
            Staff Passport core skills scope and mappings spreadsheet](https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/digital-staff-passport---core-skills-scope-and-mappings.xlsx).\n\nWhen
            receiving a core skill, LMSs should:\n- reject duplicates i.e. same competency
            name, same date last awarded\n- ignore the renewal period and expiry date,
            instead applying the local renewal period and re-calculating the expiry
            date\n\n### Right to work information\n[Right to work checks](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/right-work-checks-standard)
            must be performed by all NHS employers.\n\nThese checks are normally managed
            in a recruitment system.\n\nIf the employee has completed digital identity
            verification via Digital Staff Passport, this information can be used
            to support the right to work check.\n\nHence this API standard supports
            Digital Staff Passport sending right to work check information to a recruitment
            system.\n\n### DBS check supporting information\n[Criminal record (DBS)
            checks](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/criminal-record-checks-standard)
            must be performed by all NHS employers.\n\nThese checks are normally managed
            in a recruitment system.\n\nIf the employee has completed digital identity
            verification via Digital Staff Passport, this information can be used
            to support the DBS check.\n\nHence this API standard supports Digital
            Staff Passport sending DBS check supporting information to a recruitment
            system.\n\n## Status\nThis API standard is a [draft](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses),\nmeaning
            it is under development and might be subject to breaking changes.\n\n##
            Service level\nYour API must be a bronze service, meaning it is operational
            and supported during business hours.\n\nFor more details, see [service
            levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).\n\n##
            Technology\nThis API standard is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).\n\nIt
            does not conform to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir)\nglobal
            standard for health care data exchance because it is not a clinical API,
            it relates to workforce.\nThis has been agreed with the [HL7 FHIR UK Board](https://www.hl7.org.uk/register/about-hl7-uk/management-board-members/).\n\n##
            Network access\nYour API must be available on the internet.\n\n## Security
            and authorisation\nYour API must use OAuth 2.0 ''private key JWT'' to
            authenticate and authorise Digital Staff Passport as the calling system.\n\nFor
            more details, see [Authorisation using OAuth 2.0 private key JWT](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/digital-staff-passport-api-standard/authorisation-using-oauth-2.0-private-key-jwt).\n\n##
            Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request
            succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if it
            succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs
            to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client
            error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error
            on our server\n\nAlthough this is not a FHIR API, errors are returned
            as FHIR [OperationOutcome](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operationoutcome.html)
            resources, in line with our API design guidance.\n\nFor details of specific
            errors, see the ''Response'' section for each operation. See our [reference
            guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes)
            for more on errors.\n\n## Environments and testing\nYou''ll need to provide
            the following environments:\n\n| Environment | Suggested base URL |\n|---|---|\n|
            Integration test | `integration-test.<your domain>/dsp-api` |\n| Integration
            test | `<your domain>/dsp-api` |\n\n### Single versus multiple instance
            systems\nIf your system runs as a single instance supporting multiple
            employer organisations (sometimes called ''multiple tenant''), you should
            deploy it as per the suggested base URLs suggested above.\n\nIf you have
            a separate instance of your system per employer organisation, you should
            deploy each instance at the following base URL:\n\n`<your domain>/dsp-api/organisations/<org
            ODS code>`\n\nIn this case, you should alter the URL for the individual
            operations to exclude the `organisations/{org-id}` part, so that it isn''t
            repeated.\n\n### Integration testing\nYour integration test environment
            needs to include:\n- at least two organisations, so we can test cross-organisation
            security\n- sufficient test data to support a reasonable set of test scenarios
            - for example multiple people with the same surname or date of birth\n\n##
            Onboarding\nWe are currently running a pilot with one external system,
            so the API standard is not available for anyone else to onboard just yet.

            tools to check that the API is available and working.\n\nThe URL is `/organisations/{org-id}/_status`
            rather than just `/_status` so that it can be supported by systems that
            have separate instances deployed for each organisation.\n\nIt is based
            on the draft standard [Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-inadarei-api-health-check/).\n\nIt
            can be implemented as a ''shallow ping'' or a ''deep ping'':\n- For a
            shallow ping, the operation returns a `status` of `pass` without checking
            any dependent resources. This is the easier approach.\n- For a deep ping,
            the operation checks the status of dependent resources and returns a status
            that reflects the overall health of the service. The status of dependent
            resources is provided within the `checks` object. This approach is more
            work but allows us to react to live incidents more quickly.\n\nThe operation
            always returns an HTTP status code of 200, even if one or more of the
            dependent resources is not healthy.\nTherefore it is important for monitoring
            tools to check the `status` field in the body of the response.\n\nAll
            fields apart from `status` are optional, so the simplest possible implementation
            is a ''shallow ping'' response that always returns a single field `status`

            API status and roadmap\nThis API is for learning purposes only and is
            available in the sandbox environment.\nTo see our roadmap, or to suggest,
            comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product
            backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/107431/hello-world-api-and-tutorials).\nIf
            you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n\n##
            Technology\nThis API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest-apis).\n\n##
            Network access\nThis API is available on the internet and, indirectly,
            on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).\nTo
            use this API with NHS [smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards)
            (see below) you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives
            are available.\nFor more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\n\n##
            Security and authorisation\nThis API demonstrates the different authentication
            methods used in our APIs.\n\n### Open-access authentication \nUse the
            hello world endpoint to get a response from an open-access API. Some of
            our APIs are [open-access](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#open-access-apis),
            which means:\n - we do not authenticate or authorise the calling application\n
            - we do not authenticate or authorise the end user - they might not even
            be present\nWe generally use open-access APIs for public data, where security
            is not a concern.\nOur open-access APIs are generally RESTful APIs. For
            more details on how to access them, see our [open-access REST API tutorial](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/tutorials/open-access-rest-api-tutorial).\n\n###
            Application-restricted authentication \nUse the hello application endpoint
            to get a response from an application-restricted API. This access mode
            is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis),
            meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.\nYou
            can use this access mode as follows:\n - attended (end user present) -
            in which case, you must ensure the end user is authenticated and suitably
            authorised locally by the calling application\nTo use this access mode,
            use the following security pattern:\n - [Application-restricted RESTful
            APIs - API key authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-api-key-authentication)\n\n###
            User-restricted authentication\nUse the hello user endpoint to get a response
            from a user-restricted API. Some of our APIs are [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
            which means:\n - we authenticate and authorise the calling application\n
            - we authenticate, but do not authorise, the end user\nAlthough we do
            not authorise the end user, we do generally require the calling application
            to do it locally.\nWe only support authentication of healthcare workers.\n\n##

            Sandbox testing\nThis API is for learning purposes and is only available
            in our sandbox environment. Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):\n  -
            is for early developer testing\n  - only covers a limited set of scenarios\n  -
            is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates\n\n For more
            details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our \\\"Try
            this API\\\" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.\nAlternatively,
            you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/426d37cb9cfe17b8b96d)\n",

            Network access\nThis API is available on the internet and, indirectly,
            on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).\nTo
            use this API with NHS [smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/registration-authorities-and-smartcards)
            (see below) you do need an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives
            are available.\nFor more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\n\n##
            Security and authorisation\nThis API demonstrates the different authentication
            methods used in our APIs.\n\n### Open-access authentication \nUse the
            hello world endpoint to get a response from an open-access API. Some of
            our APIs are [open-access](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#open-access-apis),
            which means:\n - we do not authenticate or authorise the calling application\n
            - we do not authenticate or authorise the end user - they might not even
            be present\nWe generally use open-access APIs for public data, where security
            is not a concern.\nOur open-access APIs are generally RESTful APIs. For
            more details on how to access them, see our [open-access REST API tutorial](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/tutorials/open-access-rest-api-tutorial).\n\n###
            Application-restricted authentication \nUse the hello application endpoint
            to get a response from an application-restricted API. This access mode
            is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis),
            meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.\nYou
            can use this access mode as follows:\n - attended (end user present) -
            in which case, you must ensure the end user is authenticated and suitably
            authorised locally by the calling application\nTo use this access mode,
            use the following security pattern:\n - [Application-restricted RESTful
            APIs - API key authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-api-key-authentication)\n\n###
            User-restricted authentication\nUse the hello user endpoint to get a response
            from a user-restricted API. Some of our APIs are [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
            which means:\n - we authenticate and authorise the calling application\n
            - we authenticate, but do not authorise, the end user\nAlthough we do
            not authorise the end user, we do generally require the calling application
            to do it locally.\nWe only support authentication of healthcare workers.\n\n##

            Sandbox testing\nThis API is for learning purposes and is only available
            in our sandbox environment. Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):\n  -
            is for early developer testing\n  - only covers a limited set of scenarios\n  -

                <p>These <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/introduction-to-healthcare-technology/integration-and-apis#api-standards">API standards</a>&nbsp;cover a set of messaging specifications known as the <a href="content">Interoperability Toolkit (ITK)</a>. Primarily consisting of ITK Release 2 (ITK2), they also include earlier versions.</p>

                <p>They're used, for example, for sending messages about the admission, discharge and transfer (ADT) of a patient.</p>

                <p>They are based on HL7 V2 and HL7 V3 standards. For example, ITK2.2 includes specific messaging domains based on HL7 V2, and also a number of message domains based on HL7 V3 - most notably the&nbsp;<a href="release-2.2">CDA messaging specifications</a>&nbsp;which are used by&nbsp;<a href="content_2">NHS 111 domain messaging</a>.</p>

                <p>For more details on this API standard, see the Interoperability Toolkit Core download below.</p>

                <p>These&nbsp;API standards were later supplemented by the <a href="content_1">Interoperability Toolkit 3 (ITK3) Messaging Distribution FHIR API standards</a>&nbsp;to support newer specifications, for example Transfer of Care, which is not supported under ITK2.</p>

            Service Desk"},"description":"## Overview\n\nYou interact with MESH by
            making calls to this API from your application.\n\nWith the API, you can:\n\n-
            check the number of messages in your inbox\n- send a message, or a larger
            message as series of chunks\n- download a message, or a larger message
            which was sent to you as a series of chunks\n- acknowledge the successful
            download of a message, which removes it from your inbox\n- get the identifiers
            of messages in your inbox that are ready for download\n- track the status
            of messages that you sent from your outbox\n- look up the mailbox of an
            organisation you want to send data to\n- validate your mailbox every 24
            hours to let Spine know it''s still active\n\n## Who can use this API\n\nThis
            API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. We''ll ask
            you to demonstrate this as part of the digital onboarding process before
            your software goes live.\n\n## Requirements for using this API\nThere
            are 2 parts to getting the MESH API, these are:\n\n1. developing and integrating
            your software\n2. getting your software approved to go live\n\n### 1.
            Developing and integrating your software\n\nYou''ll need some things at
            different stages of your development to integrate with the MESH API.\nFor
            each environment you use, you''ll need a:\n- MESH mailbox ID and password\n-
            Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate\n- shared secret to include
            in the MESH authorization header\n\n### 2. Getting your software approved
            to go live\n\nThis is also called digital onboarding. You''ll need to
            submit information that demonstrates:\n- you have a valid use case\n-
            you can manage risks\n- your software conforms technically with the requirements
            for this API\n\n## End-to-end process to integrate with MESH API\n\nThe
            length of time it takes to get your software live depends on the resources
            your organisation puts into:\n- developing your software\n- getting things
            you need for your integration like TLS certificates\n- completing onboarding
            processes and waiting for approval\n\nYou can do some things while you
            wait, but expect the end-to-end integration process to take 1 month or
            more.\n\n### Get started\n\nTo get started, sign in or create a developer
            account for digital onboarding, complete the ''Setup and eligibility''
            section and submit it.\n\nIf you''re new to digital onboarding, add your
            product and select ''MESH'' from the ''APIs to be used'' list.\nSubmitting
            this information shows us that you have a legal basis to use the MESH
            API. We''ll review the information you submit and respond within 5 to
            10 working days.\n\nIf we approve your request to use the MESH API, we''ll
            also email you a supplier pack within 10 working days. Read through this
            as it contains the testing requirements you''ll need to fulfil later on.\n\nYou
            should get your use case approved before you go too far with development.
            You can choose to proceed with your integration while you wait for approval,
            but you''ll be doing this at your own risk.\n\n [Sign in or create a developer
            account for digital onboarding](https://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk)\n\n\nYou
            will receive a response within 10 working days.\n\nIf you have been approved
            to use the MESH API, our assurance team will contact you via email with
            a supplier pack containing the testing requirements you will need to fulfill.
            You will work alongside this team to get your solution assured.\n\n###
            Request a mailbox\n\nOnce we''ve approved your request to use the MESH
            API, you''ll need to request a MESH Mailbox to use in a ''Path to Live
            integration environment''. This is how you''ll interact with the MESH
            API. A MESH Mailbox is secure and only your organisation can access it.\n\nTo
            request a MESH Mailbox, you''ll need to fill in an online form. It takes
            5 to 10 minutes to complete.\n\nYou''ll need to know:\n- your [ODS code](https://odsportal.digital.nhs.uk/)\n-
            the [workflow groups or IDs](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/workflow-groups-and-workflow-ids)
            for the files you plan to send or receive\n- the contact details of the
            person who will be managing the mailbox in your organisation\n\n[Request
            a ''Path to Live integration'' MESH Mailbox](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/messaging-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-apply-for-a-mailbox)\n\n###
            Receive your credentials for the ''Path to Live integration'' environment\n\nOnce
            you''ve requested a MESH Mailbox, we will email you your Mailbox ID and
            password within 5 working days. Keep these details safe as we''ll also
            ask you for this if you need help from our support teams.\n\nYou will
            also receive the shared secret. You''ll need to include this in the [MESH
            authorization header](#overview--mesh-authorization-header) when you develop
            this part of your software.\n\n### Get a TLS certificate\n\nYou''ll need
            a TLS certificate to establish a secure connection to MESH.\n\nHow to
            get a TLS certificate\n\n1. Generate a private key using your preferred
            method, with the naming convention cn=mailboxid.odscode.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk\n2.
            Generate a certificate signing request (CSR) based on the private key
            and your Mailbox ID.\n3. Email the CSR to [itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net](mailto:itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net)
            - this needs to contain the common name from your CSR ''Subject'' using
            the format local_id.ods_code.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk\n\nThe local_id is
            a local identifier such as a server name and ods_code is your ODS code,
            for example, SERVER001.X26.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk.\n\nOnce we receive
            your CSR, we''ll send you a TLS certificate within 5 working days.\n\nDepending
            on how you implement MESH API, you may also need to [download a RootCA
            and SubCA certificate](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/path-to-live-environments/integration-environment#rootca-and-subca-certificates).
            These are also required to establish a secure connection.\n\n### Develop
            and test your software\n\nNow that you have a MESH Mailbox for a ''Path
            to Live integration'' environment and a TLS certificate, start developing
            your software using the MESH API.\n\nWhen you''re ready to go live, you''ll
            need to:\n- request a TLS certificate for the production environment\n-
            request a MESH mailbox for the production environment\n- get a conformance
            certificate\n- sign a connection agreement\n\n### Submit non-functional
            requirements\n\nOnce you''ve developed your software, you''ll need to
            answer some questions in digital onboarding about the processes you use
            for:\n- handling data securely\n- managing clinical risk\n- using our
            production environment\n\nThis shows that your software meets our non-functional
            requirements.\n\n[Sign in to the digital onboarding to answer questions
            on ''non-functional'' requirements](https://identity.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/auth/realms/developer-identity/login-actions/authenticate?client_id=digital-onboarding-service&tab_id=YTe9EqJeUCc)\n\n###
            Demonstrate technical conformance\n\nBefore you can go live, in digital
            onboarding, you''ll need to:\n- answer some questions to show you conform
            to the technical requirements of our APIs\n- upload a conformance certificate\n\nTo
            get a technical conformance certificate, you''ll need to complete the
            testing requirements in the supplier pack we sent to you.\n\nSome of these
            tests have to be witnessed by us. To arrange a witness test, reply to
            the email that contains the supplier pack. The witness testing takes 2
            to 3 hours.\n\nIn some cases, we may ask you to prepare test data a few
            days before the day of the witness testing.\n\nWhen you''ve completed
            a witness test, we''ll email a technical conformance certificate to you
            within 5 working days. You can then upload it to digital onboarding.\n\n[Sign
            in to the digital onboarding to upload a technical conformance certificate](https://identity.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/auth/realms/developer-identity/login-actions/authenticate?client_id=digital-onboarding-service&tab_id=vYrgcflr9fs)\n\n###
            Get a MESH Mailbox for your live software\n\nWhen you''re ready to send
            or receive real data, you''ll need a MESH Mailbox in the production environment.
            We''ll ask to see the conformance certificate for your software before
            we issue this.\n\nMESH Mailboxes are specific to environments, this means
            you''ll need a different MESH Mailbox ID for each environment you use.\n\nTo
            request a MESH Mailbox, you''ll need to fill in an online form. It takes
            5 to 10 minutes to complete.\n\nYou''ll need to know:\n- your [ODS code](https://odsportal.digital.nhs.uk/)\n-
            the [workflow groups or IDs](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/workflow-groups-and-workflow-ids)
            for the files you plan to send or receive\n- the contact details of the
            person who will be managing the mailbox in your organisation\n\n[Request
            a ''Live'' MESH Mailbox](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/messaging-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-apply-for-a-mailbox)\n\n###
            Get a TLS certificate for the production environment\n\nOnce you have
            a Mailbox ID, you''ll need to get a TLS certificate. This allows you to
            establish a secure connection to MESH in the production environment.\n\nHow
            to get a TLS certificate\n1. Generate a private key using your preferred
            method, with the naming convention cn=mailboxid.odscode.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk\n2.
            Generate a CSR based on the private key and your Mailbox ID\n3. Email
            the CSR and technical conformance certificate to [ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.uk](mailto:ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.uk)
            - this needs to contain the common name from your CSR ''Subject'' using
            the format local_id.ods_code.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk\n\nThe local_id is
            a local identifier such as a server name and ods_code is your ODS code,
            for example, SERVER001.X26.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk.\n\nOnce we receive
            your CSR and technical conformance certificate, we''ll send you a TLS
            certificate for the production environment within 5 working days.\n\nDepending
            on how you implement MESH API, you may also need to [download a RootCA
            and SubCA certificate](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/path-to-live-environments/integration-environment#rootca-and-subca-certificates).
            These are also required to establish a secure connection.\n\n\n### Sign
            connection agreement\n\nYou''ll need to sign a connection agreement before
            your software can go live. Once you''ve signed it, you need to upload
            it to the ''Legal agreement'' section in digital onboarding. We''ll email
            your connection agreement to you within 5 working days of completing your
            witness test.\n\n[Sign in to the digital onboarding to upload your connection
            agreement](https://identity.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/auth/realms/developer-identity/login-actions/authenticate?client_id=digital-onboarding-service&tab_id=p19cQckpJso)\n\n###
            Go live with your software\n\nYou have now completed all integration and
            onboarding steps. This means you can use the MESH API with your live software.\n\n##
            Related APIs\nA number of our APIs are messaging APIs that use MESH as
            the transport layer. For a full list, see [our API catalogue, filtered
            on MESH APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue?filter=mesh).\n\nIn
            particular, this includes [National Event Management Service - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/national-events-management-service-fhir)
            -\nour API for publishing and subscribing to healthcare events such as
            updates to patient demographic details.\n\n## API status and roadmap\nThis
            API is [in production](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).\n\nTo

            Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request
            succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if it
            succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs
            to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client
            error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error
            on our server\n\nErrors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints
            section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes)
            for more on errors.\n\n## Open source\nWe have a number of open source

            Environments and testing\nThere are multiple externally accessible instances
            of MESH that can be used for testing, each with a different root URL.\n\n\n|
            Purpose       | Network availability | URL                                       |\n|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|

            different client TLS certificates.\n\nFor any questions about our testing
            environments, contact our support mailbox [itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net](mailto:itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net).\n\n###
            Develop against a local MESH sandbox server\nThere is a basic sandbox
            implementation of the MESH API available [mesh-sandbox](https://github.com/NHSDigital/mesh-sandbox).\n\nThis
            sandbox can be used for local development and currently does not require
            a client certificate\n\n## API Versioning\n\nMESH API now has `live-beta`
            support for versioning on certain endpoints in order to allow us to safely
            make new features and capabilities available to API consumers.\n\nMESH
            uses the `Accept` header to support different versions in the same API,
            sending a different `Accept` header will vary the response, refer to individual
            API endpoints for more detail.\n\nIf not specified `Accept: application/json`
            will be assumed and the lowest supported response version for that particular
            endpoint will be returned.\n\n**Note:** please refer to the table below
            for more detail on the status of a given API version.\n\n| Version | Accept                                               |
            Status |\n|---------|------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|
            1       | `application/json` or `application/vnd.mesh.v1+json` | live   |\n|
            2       | `application/vnd.mesh.v2+json`                       | live   |\n\n##
            MESH Authorization header\nRequests to the MESH API require an authorisation
            token in the HTTP `Authorization` header.\nTo be valid, the authorisation
            token must match the schema described below. The token includes cryptographic
            hashes of your organisation''s MESH mailbox password and the environment-wide
            shared secret.\nAs an additional security measure each token which matches
            the schema is valid for one request only, so you must generate a new token
            for every request. Any repeated use of a token results in a `403: Not
            Authorized` response from the MESH API.\n\nThe authorisation token is
            made up of six elements. Except for the first and second elements, each
            element is separated from the next by a colon (:).\n\n| Name          |
            Description                                                                                    |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|
            `NHSMESH`     | The name of the Custom Authentication Schema. The space
            at the end of the schema is important. |\n| `mailbox_id`  | The mailbox
            identifier sending the HTTP Request. Must be uppercase.                            |\n|
            `nonce`       | A GUID used as an encryption nonce.                                                            |\n|
            `nonce_count` | The number of times that the same nonce has been used.                                         |\n|
            `timestamp`   | The current UTC date and time in `yyyyMMddHHmm` format.                                        |\n|
            `hash`        | HMAC-SHA256 hash - see the list below.                                                         |\n\nThe
            `hash` is compiled of the following items:\n\n* The `shared_key` is the
            MESH environment shared secret, provided by [itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net](mailto:itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net)
            as part of onboarding to the PTL environment.\n* The `message` is the
            concatenation of the 5 following elements, joined by a colon (:):\n  -
            `mailbox_id`\n  - `nonce`\n  - `nonce_count`\n  - `mailbox_password`\n  -
            `timestamp`\n\nChanging the `nonce` and/or `nonce_count` elements between
            requests ensures the Authorization header is unique and valid.\n\n**Notes**\n-
            the API rejects the request if the `timestamp` supplied is not within
            2 hours of the server time\n- in the example below `SHARED_KEY` has been
            `[REDACTED_SHARED_KEY]`, this is the ''environment shared secret'' which
            you received as part of creating your mailbox\n- in the example below
            `MAILBOX_PASSWORD` has been `[REDACTED_PASSWORD]`, this is the ''mesh
            mailbox password'' which you received as part of creating your mailbox\n\n###
            Example implementation\nHere is an implementation of the above in `python3`.\n```python\n\"\"\"
            Python code to generate a valid authorization header. \"\"\"\nimport hmac\nimport
            uuid\nimport datetime\nfrom hashlib import sha256\n\nAUTH_SCHEMA_NAME
            = \"NHSMESH \"  # Note: Space at the end of the schema.\nSHARED_KEY =
            \"[REDACTED_SHARED_KEY]\"  # Note: Don''t hard code your passwords in
            a real implementation.\n\n\ndef build_auth_header(mailbox_id: str, password:
            str = \"password\",  nonce: str = None, nonce_count: int = 0):\n    \"\"\"
            Generate MESH Authorization header for mailboxid. \"\"\"\n    # Generate
            a GUID if required.\n    if not nonce:\n        nonce = str(uuid.uuid4())\n    #
            Current time formatted as yyyyMMddHHmm\n    # for example, 4th May 2020
            13:05 would be 202005041305\n    timestamp = datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime(\"%Y%m%d%H%M\")\n\n    #
            for example, NHSMESH AMP01HC001:bd0e2bd5-218e-41d0-83a9-73fdec414803:0:202005041305\n    hmac_msg
            = mailbox_id + \":\" + nonce + \":\" + str(nonce_count) + \":\" + password
            + \":\" + timestamp\n\n    # HMAC is a standard crypto hash method built
            in the python standard library.\n    hash_code = hmac.HMAC(SHARED_KEY.encode(),
            hmac_msg.encode(), sha256).hexdigest()\n    return (\n            AUTH_SCHEMA_NAME
            # Note: No colon between 1st and 2nd elements.\n            + mailbox_id
            + \":\"\n            + nonce + \":\"\n            + str(nonce_count) +
            \":\"\n            + timestamp+ \":\"\n            + hash_code\n    )\n\n\n#
            example usage\nMAILBOX_ID = \"X26AB1234\" # Note: Don''t hard code your
            mailbox id in a real implementation.\nMAILBOX_PASSWORD = \"[REDACTED_PASSWORD]\"  #
            Note: Don''t hard code your passwords in a real implementation.\n\n# send
            a new nonce each time\nprint(build_auth_header(MAILBOX_ID, MAILBOX_PASSWORD))\n\n#
            or reuse the nonce and increment the nonce_count\nmy_nonce = str(uuid.uuid4())\n\nprint(build_auth_header(MAILBOX_ID,
            MAILBOX_PASSWORD, my_nonce, nonce_count=1))\nprint(build_auth_header(MAILBOX_ID,
            MAILBOX_PASSWORD, my_nonce, nonce_count=2))\n\n\n```\n\n## MESH API pseudocode\nTo
            use MESH effectively, use the following flow of API calls:\n\n- inbox
            poll cycle\n- outbox workflow\n\nValidate your mailbox once every 24 hours
            using the ''Validate a mailbox'' endpoint.\n\n### Inbox poll cycle\nSpine
            gives each message a unique message identifier after you post it to your
            outbox. It is the primary identifier for the message during MESH transit.\n\nIt
            is suggested to poll your mailbox every 5 minutes, but at least every
            24 hours. The pseudocode for a mailbox poll is:\n\n1. Poll to get the
            messageIds of messages ready to download from the ''Check an inbox'' endpoint.\n2.
            For each message identifier returned in step 1:\n    * download the message
            with the ''Download message'' endpoint\n    * if it''s identified as a
            chunked message, download all remaining chunks with the ''Download message
            chunk'' endpoint\n    * acknowledge receipt of the message via the ''Acknowledge
            message'' endpoint\n3. Repeat step 2 until you have processed the number
            of messages returned in step 1.\n4. If you received exactly 500 messages
            in step 1 then repeat from step 1, immediately polling again and downloading,
            until you receive 0 messages in step 1.\n\n### Asynchronous error reporting\nMost
            problems with message transfer are indicated synchronously (immediately)
            when you call the ''Send Message'' endpoint. However, some errors might
            occur after a successful request (asynchronously). You get any error reports
            as messages in your inbox, which you need to receive as part of your inbox
            poll cycle.\nError reports differ from regular messages in these ways:\n-
            the ''Download message endpoint'' has a different value for the `Mex-MessageType`
            header:\n  * DATA for a normal organisation-to-organisation message\n  *
            REPORT for an error report\n- the Download message response body of an
            error report message is empty\n\nWe strongly recommend you check the value
            of `Mex-MessageType` after downloading each message, so that you can take
            appropriate action if needed.\n\n| Error Report Header     | Description                                                              |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

            Outbox workflow\nThe maximum amount of data allowed by MESH in a single
            request message is 100MB. You can send larger messages by breaking them
            into \\\"chunks\\\" that are transmitted as a single message over multiple
            requests. The upper limit of a single chunked message is 100GB (20GB if
            using the java client).\n\nThe [MESH UI](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/compare-mesh-services#mesh-user-interface)
            and older versions of the MESH client do not support chunking. Check that
            the receiver''s interface to MESH for your workflow identifier handles
            chunked messages prior to sending. To do this:\n\n1. Determine the size
            of your message data (after compression) with a standard algorithm (such
            as `gzip`). If the compressed message is larger than 100MB, is smaller
            than 100GB, and the receiving mailbox / workflow identifier supports chunking,
            then you can send a chunked message. To prepare for this:\n    *  split
            the **uncompressed** data into ordered chunks\n    * **independently**
            compress each chunk with the **same** compression algorithm (such as `gzip`)
            such that each chunk is smaller than 100MB\n    * use the first chunk
            (after compression) as the initial message data\n2. Send a message with
            appropriate workflow identifier and `Mex-To` (recipient mailbox) header.
            To do this:\n    * optionally include a local identifier from step 2 for
            tracking.  This field must not contain PID.\n    * if sending a chunked
            message, include an extra header to indicate that this is the first in
            a series of chunks, then submit the subsequent chunks via the ''Send Chunked
            Message'' endpoint\n3. A message identifier will be returned which is
            the unique identifier and can be used for tracking and helping with incident
            resolution. It would be good practice to log this identifier.\n\n### Message
            expiration\nMessages that are not downloaded and acknowledged within five
            days of delivery are removed from your inbox. The sending organisation
            receives an error report explaining that the receiver did not collect
            the message. Uncollected messages are completely deleted from the MESH
            server 30 days after the initial delivery. If the sending organisation
            cannot re-send the message within the intervening time, it may contact
            our [national service desk](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support)
            with the error report details and ask for the message to be placed in
            your inbox again.\n\n## Onboarding\n\nYou need to get your software approved
            by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The
            onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it''s worth planning
            well ahead.\n\nTo understand how our online digital onboarding process
            works, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding).
            This is where you can demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your
            software conforms technically with the requirements for this API. You
            can also manage onboarding for other APIs in your account.\n\n<div class=\"nhsd-m-emphasis-box

            Overview\nUse this endpoint to send a message via MESH. Use the POST command
            to your virtual outbox. Specify the message recipient in the request headers,
            with the message contained in the request body.\n\n### Messages larger
            than 100MB\n100MB (20MB on internet) is the largest data payload the MESH
            API accepts in a single request. Compress larger messages to reduce bandwidth
            and data storage on Spine. If compression does not sufficiently reduce
            the message size enough for transmission in a single request then you
            can break it up into smaller chunks and transmit them separately provided:\n  1.  The
            total compressed size of the message is < 100MB - this is the Spine upper
            limit for a single message.\n  2.  The receiver mailbox and workflow identifier
            support the downloading of chunked messages. MESH UI and older versions
            of the MESH client do not support this.\n\nTo correctly break the outbound
            message into valid chunks:\n  1.  Split the **uncompressed** message into
            `n` ordered chunks such that each (compressed) chunk is smaller than 20MB.\n  2.  **Independently**
            compress each chunk with the same compression algorithm (e.g. `gzip`).\n  3.  The
            first (compressed) chunk of the message should be transmitted using this
            endpoint (the normal send message endpoint). Include the optional `Mex-Chunk-Range`
            header with a value `1:n` to tell Spine that this is a chunked message
            and to wait for `n-1` other requests before delivering the message. The
            message identifier of this initial server response **must** be captured
            as it is a required path element of the Send chunked message URL.\n\nAlways
            set the workflow identifier as some workflows are restricted which means
            the mailbox sender and recipient must be configured for the workflow identifier
            you send.\n\nTo discover the recipient mailbox either use the `endpointlookup`
            endpoint or for certain workflows you can include [demographic details](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/mesh-guidance-hub/endpoint-lookup-service-and-workflowids#using-the-to_dts-field-of-a-mesh-message-to-find-a-mailbox-)
            in the `Mex-To` field.\n\nIt is good practice to capture the returned
            message identifier as this provides a unique identifier which you can
            use for message tracking.\n\n### Request\n\n```shell\ncurl -k \\\n--request

            Overview\nUse this endpoint to send a chunked message. The ''Send Message''
            endpoint has a maximum single request message payload size of 100MB over
            HSCN or 20MB over the internet. However, you can send much larger messages
            (up to 20GB) by breaking up the message into chunks and transmitting it
            over multiple requests.\n\n**Note**: Some workflow ids do not support
            chunking because it is not currently supported in the MESH UI and older
            versions of the MESH client. Check with your receiving organisation before
            sending messages with this endpoint.\n\nTo send a chunked message:\n\n1.
            Split it into separate files\n2. Compress the individual chunks **separately**
            with the **same** compression program (e.g. `gzip`).\n   - **DO NOT**
            compress a large file and then split the compressed version\n3. Upload
            the first file using the normal ''Send message'' endpoint.\n   - include
            the `Mex-Chunk-Range` header with a value of `1:n` where `n` is the number
            of separate files your big data is split into\n   - capture the message
            identifier field in the returned JSON\n4. Upload subsequent files in the
            correct order using the chunked message endpoint\n\n**Note:** fewer headers
            are required for the chunked message endpoint because Spine uses the relevant
            metadata from the initial (`Mex-Chunk-Header=1:n`) call to the ''Send
            message'' endpoint.\n\n### Request\n\nSuppose Bob has a large file to
            send to Alice. In this example we will use **message.txt**. It is easily
            small enough to send in a single request, but we will chunk it anyway
            to illustrate the API calls.\n```shell\nls -sh message.txt\n4.0kb message.txt\n```\n```shell\ncat
            message.txt\n\nHi Alice,\n\nThis is Bob. It''s really nice that we can
            communicate via SPINE!\n\nI hope to hear more from you in the future,\n\nBob.\n```\n\n  First
            we break up our one \"large\" file into two smaller files. We will transmit
            one per request.\n\n```shell\nsplit -b 100 message.txt message.txt_\nls
            -sh message.txt_*\n```\n\nLarge messages should be compressed to reduce
            the bandwidth and storage requirements for Spine.\n```shell\nfor chunk_file
            in message.txt_*; do\n  gzip -k -f $chunk_file;\ndone\nls -sh message.txt_*.gz\n\n4.0kb
            message.txt_aa.gz\n4.0kb message.txt_ab.gz\n```\n```shell\ncurl -k \\\n--cacert

            Service Desk"},"description":"## Overview\n\nYou interact with MESH by
            making calls to this API from your application.\n\nWith the API, you can:\n\n-
            check the number of messages in your inbox\n- send a message, or a larger
            message as series of chunks\n- download a message, or a larger message
            which was sent to you as a series of chunks\n- acknowledge the successful
            download of a message, which removes it from your inbox\n- get the identifiers
            of messages in your inbox that are ready for download\n- track the status
            of messages that you sent from your outbox\n- look up the mailbox of an
            organisation you want to send data to\n- validate your mailbox every 24
            hours to let Spine know it''s still active\n\n## Who can use this API\n\nThis
            API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. We''ll ask
            you to demonstrate this as part of the digital onboarding process before
            your software goes live.\n\n## Requirements for using this API\nThere
            are 2 parts to getting the MESH API, these are:\n\n1. developing and integrating
            your software\n2. getting your software approved to go live\n\n### 1.
            Developing and integrating your software\n\nYou''ll need some things at
            different stages of your development to integrate with the MESH API.\nFor
            each environment you use, you''ll need a:\n- MESH mailbox ID and password\n-
            Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate\n- shared secret to include
            in the MESH authorization header\n\n### 2. Getting your software approved
            to go live\n\nThis is also called digital onboarding. You''ll need to
            submit information that demonstrates:\n- you have a valid use case\n-
            you can manage risks\n- your software conforms technically with the requirements
            for this API\n\n## End-to-end process to integrate with MESH API\n\nThe
            length of time it takes to get your software live depends on the resources
            your organisation puts into:\n- developing your software\n- getting things
            you need for your integration like TLS certificates\n- completing onboarding
            processes and waiting for approval\n\nYou can do some things while you
            wait, but expect the end-to-end integration process to take 1 month or
            more.\n\n### Get started\n\nTo get started, sign in or create a developer
            account for digital onboarding, complete the ''Setup and eligibility''
            section and submit it.\n\nIf you''re new to digital onboarding, add your
            product and select ''MESH'' from the ''APIs to be used'' list.\nSubmitting
            this information shows us that you have a legal basis to use the MESH
            API. We''ll review the information you submit and respond within 5 to
            10 working days.\n\nIf we approve your request to use the MESH API, we''ll
            also email you a supplier pack within 10 working days. Read through this
            as it contains the testing requirements you''ll need to fulfil later on.\n\nYou
            should get your use case approved before you go too far with development.
            You can choose to proceed with your integration while you wait for approval,
            but you''ll be doing this at your own risk.\n\n [Sign in or create a developer
            account for digital onboarding](https://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk)\n\n\nYou
            will receive a response within 10 working days.\n\nIf you have been approved
            to use the MESH API, our assurance team will contact you via email with
            a supplier pack containing the testing requirements you will need to fulfill.
            You will work alongside this team to get your solution assured.\n\n###
            Request a mailbox\n\nOnce we''ve approved your request to use the MESH
            API, you''ll need to request a MESH Mailbox to use in a ''Path to Live
            integration environment''. This is how you''ll interact with the MESH
            API. A MESH Mailbox is secure and only your organisation can access it.\n\nTo
            request a MESH Mailbox, you''ll need to fill in an online form. It takes
            5 to 10 minutes to complete.\n\nYou''ll need to know:\n- your [ODS code](https://odsportal.digital.nhs.uk/)\n-
            the [workflow groups or IDs](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/workflow-groups-and-workflow-ids)
            for the files you plan to send or receive\n- the contact details of the
            person who will be managing the mailbox in your organisation\n\n[Request
            a ''Path to Live integration'' MESH Mailbox](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/messaging-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-apply-for-a-mailbox)\n\n###
            Receive your credentials for the ''Path to Live integration'' environment\n\nOnce
            you''ve requested a MESH Mailbox, we will email you your Mailbox ID and
            password within 5 working days. Keep these details safe as we''ll also
            ask you for this if you need help from our support teams.\n\nYou will
            also receive the shared secret. You''ll need to include this in the [MESH
            authorization header](#overview--mesh-authorization-header) when you develop
            this part of your software.\n\n### Get a TLS certificate\n\nYou''ll need
            a TLS certificate to establish a secure connection to MESH.\n\nHow to
            get a TLS certificate\n\n1. Generate a private key using your preferred
            method, with the naming convention cn=mailboxid.odscode.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk\n2.
            Generate a certificate signing request (CSR) based on the private key
            and your Mailbox ID.\n3. Email the CSR to [itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net](mailto:itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net)
            - this needs to contain the common name from your CSR ''Subject'' using
            the format local_id.ods_code.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk\n\nThe local_id is
            a local identifier such as a server name and ods_code is your ODS code,
            for example, SERVER001.X26.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk.\n\nOnce we receive
            your CSR, we''ll send you a TLS certificate within 5 working days.\n\nDepending
            on how you implement MESH API, you may also need to [download a RootCA
            and SubCA certificate](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/path-to-live-environments/integration-environment#rootca-and-subca-certificates).
            These are also required to establish a secure connection.\n\n### Develop
            and test your software\n\nNow that you have a MESH Mailbox for a ''Path
            to Live integration'' environment and a TLS certificate, start developing
            your software using the MESH API.\n\nWhen you''re ready to go live, you''ll
            need to:\n- request a TLS certificate for the production environment\n-
            request a MESH mailbox for the production environment\n- get a conformance
            certificate\n- sign a connection agreement\n\n### Submit non-functional
            requirements\n\nOnce you''ve developed your software, you''ll need to
            answer some questions in digital onboarding about the processes you use
            for:\n- handling data securely\n- managing clinical risk\n- using our
            production environment\n\nThis shows that your software meets our non-functional
            requirements.\n\n[Sign in to the digital onboarding to answer questions
            on ''non-functional'' requirements](https://identity.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/auth/realms/developer-identity/login-actions/authenticate?client_id=digital-onboarding-service&tab_id=YTe9EqJeUCc)\n\n###
            Demonstrate technical conformance\n\nBefore you can go live, in digital
            onboarding, you''ll need to:\n- answer some questions to show you conform
            to the technical requirements of our APIs\n- upload a conformance certificate\n\nTo
            get a technical conformance certificate, you''ll need to complete the
            testing requirements in the supplier pack we sent to you.\n\nSome of these
            tests have to be witnessed by us. To arrange a witness test, reply to
            the email that contains the supplier pack. The witness testing takes 2
            to 3 hours.\n\nIn some cases, we may ask you to prepare test data a few
            days before the day of the witness testing.\n\nWhen you''ve completed
            a witness test, we''ll email a technical conformance certificate to you
            within 5 working days. You can then upload it to digital onboarding.\n\n[Sign
            in to the digital onboarding to upload a technical conformance certificate](https://identity.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/auth/realms/developer-identity/login-actions/authenticate?client_id=digital-onboarding-service&tab_id=vYrgcflr9fs)\n\n###
            Get a MESH Mailbox for your live software\n\nWhen you''re ready to send
            or receive real data, you''ll need a MESH Mailbox in the production environment.
            We''ll ask to see the conformance certificate for your software before
            we issue this.\n\nMESH Mailboxes are specific to environments, this means
            you''ll need a different MESH Mailbox ID for each environment you use.\n\nTo
            request a MESH Mailbox, you''ll need to fill in an online form. It takes
            5 to 10 minutes to complete.\n\nYou''ll need to know:\n- your [ODS code](https://odsportal.digital.nhs.uk/)\n-
            the [workflow groups or IDs](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/workflow-groups-and-workflow-ids)
            for the files you plan to send or receive\n- the contact details of the
            person who will be managing the mailbox in your organisation\n\n[Request
            a ''Live'' MESH Mailbox](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/messaging-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-apply-for-a-mailbox)\n\n###
            Get a TLS certificate for the production environment\n\nOnce you have
            a Mailbox ID, you''ll need to get a TLS certificate. This allows you to
            establish a secure connection to MESH in the production environment.\n\nHow
            to get a TLS certificate\n1. Generate a private key using your preferred
            method, with the naming convention cn=mailboxid.odscode.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk\n2.
            Generate a CSR based on the private key and your Mailbox ID\n3. Email
            the CSR and technical conformance certificate to [ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.uk](mailto:ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.uk)
            - this needs to contain the common name from your CSR ''Subject'' using
            the format local_id.ods_code.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk\n\nThe local_id is
            a local identifier such as a server name and ods_code is your ODS code,
            for example, SERVER001.X26.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk.\n\nOnce we receive
            your CSR and technical conformance certificate, we''ll send you a TLS
            certificate for the production environment within 5 working days.\n\nDepending
            on how you implement MESH API, you may also need to [download a RootCA
            and SubCA certificate](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/path-to-live-environments/integration-environment#rootca-and-subca-certificates).
            These are also required to establish a secure connection.\n\n\n### Sign
            connection agreement\n\nYou''ll need to sign a connection agreement before
            your software can go live. Once you''ve signed it, you need to upload
            it to the ''Legal agreement'' section in digital onboarding. We''ll email
            your connection agreement to you within 5 working days of completing your
            witness test.\n\n[Sign in to the digital onboarding to upload your connection
            agreement](https://identity.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/auth/realms/developer-identity/login-actions/authenticate?client_id=digital-onboarding-service&tab_id=p19cQckpJso)\n\n###
            Go live with your software\n\nYou have now completed all integration and
            onboarding steps. This means you can use the MESH API with your live software.\n\n##
            Related APIs\nA number of our APIs are messaging APIs that use MESH as
            the transport layer. For a full list, see [our API catalogue, filtered
            on MESH APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue?filter=mesh).\n\nIn

            |\n\n**Note** - each environment has the same shared secret but requires
            different client TLS certificates.\n\nFor any questions about our testing
            environments, contact our support mailbox [itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net](mailto:itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net).\n\n###
            Develop against a local MESH sandbox server\nThere is a basic sandbox
            implementation of the MESH API available [mesh-sandbox](https://github.com/NHSDigital/mesh-sandbox).\n\nThis
            sandbox can be used for local development and currently does not require
            a client certificate\n\n## API Versioning\n\nMESH API now has `live-beta`
            support for versioning on certain endpoints in order to allow us to safely
            make new features and capabilities available to API consumers.\n\nMESH
            uses the `Accept` header to support different versions in the same API,
            sending a different `Accept` header will vary the response, refer to individual
            API endpoints for more detail.\n\nIf not specified `Accept: application/json`
            will be assumed and the lowest supported response version for that particular
            endpoint will be returned.\n\n**Note:** please refer to the table below
            for more detail on the status of a given API version.\n\n| Version | Accept                                               |
            Status |\n|---------|------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|
            1       | `application/json` or `application/vnd.mesh.v1+json` | live   |\n|
            2       | `application/vnd.mesh.v2+json`                       | live   |\n\n##
            MESH Authorization header\nRequests to the MESH API require an authorisation
            token in the HTTP `Authorization` header.\nTo be valid, the authorisation
            token must match the schema described below. The token includes cryptographic
            hashes of your organisation''s MESH mailbox password and the environment-wide
            shared secret.\nAs an additional security measure each token which matches
            the schema is valid for one request only, so you must generate a new token
            for every request. Any repeated use of a token results in a `403: Not
            Authorized` response from the MESH API.\n\nThe authorisation token is
            made up of six elements. Except for the first and second elements, each
            element is separated from the next by a colon (:).\n\n| Name          |
            Description                                                                                    |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|
            `NHSMESH`     | The name of the Custom Authentication Schema. The space
            at the end of the schema is important. |\n| `mailbox_id`  | The mailbox
            identifier sending the HTTP Request. Must be uppercase.                            |\n|
            `nonce`       | A GUID used as an encryption nonce.                                                            |\n|
            `nonce_count` | The number of times that the same nonce has been used.                                         |\n|
            `timestamp`   | The current UTC date and time in `yyyyMMddHHmm` format.                                        |\n|
            `hash`        | HMAC-SHA256 hash - see the list below.                                                         |\n\nThe
            `hash` is compiled of the following items:\n\n* The `shared_key` is the
            MESH environment shared secret, provided by [itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net](mailto:itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net)
            as part of onboarding to the PTL environment.\n* The `message` is the
            concatenation of the 5 following elements, joined by a colon (:):\n  -
            `mailbox_id`\n  - `nonce`\n  - `nonce_count`\n  - `mailbox_password`\n  -
            `timestamp`\n\nChanging the `nonce` and/or `nonce_count` elements between
            requests ensures the Authorization header is unique and valid.\n\n**Notes**\n-
            the API rejects the request if the `timestamp` supplied is not within
            2 hours of the server time\n- in the example below `SHARED_KEY` has been
            `[REDACTED_SHARED_KEY]`, this is the ''environment shared secret'' which
            you received as part of creating your mailbox\n- in the example below
            `MAILBOX_PASSWORD` has been `[REDACTED_PASSWORD]`, this is the ''mesh
            mailbox password'' which you received as part of creating your mailbox\n\n###
            Example implementation\nHere is an implementation of the above in `python3`.\n```python\n\"\"\"
            Python code to generate a valid authorization header. \"\"\"\nimport hmac\nimport
            uuid\nimport datetime\nfrom hashlib import sha256\n\nAUTH_SCHEMA_NAME
            = \"NHSMESH \"  # Note: Space at the end of the schema.\nSHARED_KEY =
            \"[REDACTED_SHARED_KEY]\"  # Note: Don''t hard code your passwords in
            a real implementation.\n\n\ndef build_auth_header(mailbox_id: str, password:
            str = \"password\",  nonce: str = None, nonce_count: int = 0):\n    \"\"\"
            Generate MESH Authorization header for mailboxid. \"\"\"\n    # Generate
            a GUID if required.\n    if not nonce:\n        nonce = str(uuid.uuid4())\n    #
            Current time formatted as yyyyMMddHHmm\n    # for example, 4th May 2020
            13:05 would be 202005041305\n    timestamp = datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime(\"%Y%m%d%H%M\")\n\n    #
            for example, NHSMESH AMP01HC001:bd0e2bd5-218e-41d0-83a9-73fdec414803:0:202005041305\n    hmac_msg
            = mailbox_id + \":\" + nonce + \":\" + str(nonce_count) + \":\" + password
            + \":\" + timestamp\n\n    # HMAC is a standard crypto hash method built
            in the python standard library.\n    hash_code = hmac.HMAC(SHARED_KEY.encode(),
            hmac_msg.encode(), sha256).hexdigest()\n    return (\n            AUTH_SCHEMA_NAME
            # Note: No colon between 1st and 2nd elements.\n            + mailbox_id
            + \":\"\n            + nonce + \":\"\n            + str(nonce_count) +
            \":\"\n            + timestamp+ \":\"\n            + hash_code\n    )\n\n\n#
            example usage\nMAILBOX_ID = \"X26AB1234\" # Note: Don''t hard code your
            mailbox id in a real implementation.\nMAILBOX_PASSWORD = \"[REDACTED_PASSWORD]\"  #
            Note: Don''t hard code your passwords in a real implementation.\n\n# send
            a new nonce each time\nprint(build_auth_header(MAILBOX_ID, MAILBOX_PASSWORD))\n\n#
            or reuse the nonce and increment the nonce_count\nmy_nonce = str(uuid.uuid4())\n\nprint(build_auth_header(MAILBOX_ID,
            MAILBOX_PASSWORD, my_nonce, nonce_count=1))\nprint(build_auth_header(MAILBOX_ID,
            MAILBOX_PASSWORD, my_nonce, nonce_count=2))\n\n\n```\n\n## MESH API pseudocode\nTo
            use MESH effectively, use the following flow of API calls:\n\n- inbox
            poll cycle\n- outbox workflow\n\nValidate your mailbox once every 24 hours
            using the ''Validate a mailbox'' endpoint.\n\n### Inbox poll cycle\nSpine
            gives each message a unique message identifier after you post it to your
            outbox. It is the primary identifier for the message during MESH transit.\n\nIt
            is suggested to poll your mailbox every 5 minutes, but at least every
            24 hours. The pseudocode for a mailbox poll is:\n\n1. Poll to get the
            messageIds of messages ready to download from the ''Check an inbox'' endpoint.\n2.
            For each message identifier returned in step 1:\n    * download the message
            with the ''Download message'' endpoint\n    * if it''s identified as a
            chunked message, download all remaining chunks with the ''Download message
            chunk'' endpoint\n    * acknowledge receipt of the message via the ''Acknowledge
            message'' endpoint\n3. Repeat step 2 until you have processed the number
            of messages returned in step 1.\n4. If you received exactly 500 messages
            in step 1 then repeat from step 1, immediately polling again and downloading,
            until you receive 0 messages in step 1.\n\n### Asynchronous error reporting\nMost
            problems with message transfer are indicated synchronously (immediately)
            when you call the ''Send Message'' endpoint. However, some errors might
            occur after a successful request (asynchronously). You get any error reports
            as messages in your inbox, which you need to receive as part of your inbox
            poll cycle.\nError reports differ from regular messages in these ways:\n-
            the ''Download message endpoint'' has a different value for the `Mex-MessageType`
            header:\n  * DATA for a normal organisation-to-organisation message\n  *
            REPORT for an error report\n- the Download message response body of an
            error report message is empty\n\nWe strongly recommend you check the value
            of `Mex-MessageType` after downloading each message, so that you can take
            appropriate action if needed.\n\n| Error Report Header     | Description                                                              |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

            Outbox workflow\nThe maximum amount of data allowed by MESH in a single
            request message is 100MB. You can send larger messages by breaking them
            into \\\"chunks\\\" that are transmitted as a single message over multiple
            requests. The upper limit of a single chunked message is 100GB (20GB if
            using the java client).\n\nThe [MESH UI](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/compare-mesh-services#mesh-user-interface)
            and older versions of the MESH client do not support chunking. Check that
            the receiver''s interface to MESH for your workflow identifier handles
            chunked messages prior to sending. To do this:\n\n1. Determine the size
            of your message data (after compression) with a standard algorithm (such
            as `gzip`). If the compressed message is larger than 100MB, is smaller
            than 100GB, and the receiving mailbox / workflow identifier supports chunking,
            then you can send a chunked message. To prepare for this:\n    *  split
            the **uncompressed** data into ordered chunks\n    * **independently**
            compress each chunk with the **same** compression algorithm (such as `gzip`)
            such that each chunk is smaller than 100MB\n    * use the first chunk
            (after compression) as the initial message data\n2. Send a message with
            appropriate workflow identifier and `Mex-To` (recipient mailbox) header.
            To do this:\n    * optionally include a local identifier from step 2 for
            tracking.  This field must not contain PID.\n    * if sending a chunked
            message, include an extra header to indicate that this is the first in
            a series of chunks, then submit the subsequent chunks via the ''Send Chunked
            Message'' endpoint\n3. A message identifier will be returned which is
            the unique identifier and can be used for tracking and helping with incident
            resolution. It would be good practice to log this identifier.\n\n### Message
            expiration\nMessages that are not downloaded and acknowledged within five
            days of delivery are removed from your inbox. The sending organisation
            receives an error report explaining that the receiver did not collect
            the message. Uncollected messages are completely deleted from the MESH
            server 30 days after the initial delivery. If the sending organisation
            cannot re-send the message within the intervening time, it may contact
            our [national service desk](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support)
            with the error report details and ask for the message to be placed in
            your inbox again.\n\n## Onboarding\n\nYou need to get your software approved
            by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The
            onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it''s worth planning
            well ahead.\n\nTo understand how our online digital onboarding process
            works, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding).
            This is where you can demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your
            software conforms technically with the requirements for this API. You
            can also manage onboarding for other APIs in your account.\n\n<div class=\"nhsd-m-emphasis-box

            Overview\nUse this endpoint to send a message via MESH. Use the POST command
            to your virtual outbox. Specify the message recipient in the request headers,
            with the message contained in the request body.\n\n### Messages larger
            than 100MB\n100MB (20MB on internet) is the largest data payload the MESH
            API accepts in a single request. Compress larger messages to reduce bandwidth
            and data storage on Spine. If compression does not sufficiently reduce
            the message size enough for transmission in a single request then you
            can break it up into smaller chunks and transmit them separately provided:\n  1.  The
            total compressed size of the message is < 100MB - this is the Spine upper
            limit for a single message.\n  2.  The receiver mailbox and workflow identifier
            support the downloading of chunked messages. MESH UI and older versions
            of the MESH client do not support this.\n\nTo correctly break the outbound
            message into valid chunks:\n  1.  Split the **uncompressed** message into
            `n` ordered chunks such that each (compressed) chunk is smaller than 20MB.\n  2.  **Independently**
            compress each chunk with the same compression algorithm (e.g. `gzip`).\n  3.  The
            first (compressed) chunk of the message should be transmitted using this
            endpoint (the normal send message endpoint). Include the optional `Mex-Chunk-Range`
            header with a value `1:n` to tell Spine that this is a chunked message
            and to wait for `n-1` other requests before delivering the message. The
            message identifier of this initial server response **must** be captured
            as it is a required path element of the Send chunked message URL.\n\nAlways
            set the workflow identifier as some workflows are restricted which means
            the mailbox sender and recipient must be configured for the workflow identifier
            you send.\n\nTo discover the recipient mailbox either use the `endpointlookup`
            endpoint or for certain workflows you can include [demographic details](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/mesh-guidance-hub/endpoint-lookup-service-and-workflowids#using-the-to_dts-field-of-a-mesh-message-to-find-a-mailbox-)
            in the `Mex-To` field.\n\nIt is good practice to capture the returned
            message identifier as this provides a unique identifier which you can
            use for message tracking.\n\n### Request\n\n```shell\ncurl -k \\\n--request

            Overview\nUse this endpoint to send a chunked message. The ''Send Message''
            endpoint has a maximum single request message payload size of 100MB over
            HSCN or 20MB over the internet. However, you can send much larger messages
            (up to 20GB) by breaking up the message into chunks and transmitting it
            over multiple requests.\n\n**Note**: Some workflow ids do not support
            chunking because it is not currently supported in the MESH UI and older
            versions of the MESH client. Check with your receiving organisation before
            sending messages with this endpoint.\n\nTo send a chunked message:\n\n1.
            Split it into separate files\n2. Compress the individual chunks **separately**
            with the **same** compression program (e.g. `gzip`).\n   - **DO NOT**
            compress a large file and then split the compressed version\n3. Upload
            the first file using the normal ''Send message'' endpoint.\n   - include
            the `Mex-Chunk-Range` header with a value of `1:n` where `n` is the number
            of separate files your big data is split into\n   - capture the message
            identifier field in the returned JSON\n4. Upload subsequent files in the
            correct order using the chunked message endpoint\n\n**Note:** fewer headers
            are required for the chunked message endpoint because Spine uses the relevant
            metadata from the initial (`Mex-Chunk-Header=1:n`) call to the ''Send
            message'' endpoint.\n\n### Request\n\nSuppose Bob has a large file to
            send to Alice. In this example we will use **message.txt**. It is easily
            small enough to send in a single request, but we will chunk it anyway
            to illustrate the API calls.\n```shell\nls -sh message.txt\n4.0kb message.txt\n```\n```shell\ncat
            message.txt\n\nHi Alice,\n\nThis is Bob. It''s really nice that we can
            communicate via SPINE!\n\nI hope to hear more from you in the future,\n\nBob.\n```\n\n  First
            we break up our one \"large\" file into two smaller files. We will transmit
            one per request.\n\n```shell\nsplit -b 100 message.txt message.txt_\nls
            -sh message.txt_*\n```\n\nLarge messages should be compressed to reduce
            the bandwidth and storage requirements for Spine.\n```shell\nfor chunk_file
            in message.txt_*; do\n  gzip -k -f $chunk_file;\ndone\nls -sh message.txt_*.gz\n\n4.0kb

            until the recipient downloads your message. You must not poll this endpoint
            frequently.\n\nThe message identifier is the value returned in the response
            to a message upload.\n\nDo not use this endpoint to replace a business
            ack message. If the business process requires confirmation that the recipient
            has processed the message then send a business ACK over MESH. The convention
            is to use the same workflow identifier appended with `_ACK`.\n\n### Request\nIt

            Service Desk"},"description":"## Overview\n\nYou interact with MESH by
            making calls to this API from your application.\n\nWith the API, you can:\n\n-
            check the number of messages in your inbox\n- send a message, or a larger
            message as series of chunks\n- download a message, or a larger message
            which was sent to you as a series of chunks\n- acknowledge the successful
            download of a message, which removes it from your inbox\n- get the identifiers
            of messages in your inbox that are ready for download\n- track the status
            of messages that you sent from your outbox\n- look up the mailbox of an
            organisation you want to send data to\n- validate your mailbox every 24
            hours to let Spine know it''s still active\n\n## Who can use this API\n\nThis
            API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. We''ll ask
            you to demonstrate this as part of the digital onboarding process before
            your software goes live.\n\n## Requirements for using this API\nThere
            are 2 parts to getting the MESH API, these are:\n\n1. developing and integrating
            your software\n2. getting your software approved to go live\n\n### 1.
            Developing and integrating your software\n\nYou''ll need some things at
            different stages of your development to integrate with the MESH API.\nFor
            each environment you use, you''ll need a:\n- MESH mailbox ID and password\n-
            Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate\n- shared secret to include
            in the MESH authorization header\n\n### 2. Getting your software approved
            to go live\n\nThis is also called digital onboarding. You''ll need to
            submit information that demonstrates:\n- you have a valid use case\n-
            you can manage risks\n- your software conforms technically with the requirements
            for this API\n\n## End-to-end process to integrate with MESH API\n\nThe
            length of time it takes to get your software live depends on the resources
            your organisation puts into:\n- developing your software\n- getting things
            you need for your integration like TLS certificates\n- completing onboarding
            processes and waiting for approval\n\nYou can do some things while you
            wait, but expect the end-to-end integration process to take 1 month or
            more.\n\n### Get started\n\nTo get started, sign in or create a developer
            account for digital onboarding, complete the ''Setup and eligibility''
            section and submit it.\n\nIf you''re new to digital onboarding, add your
            product and select ''MESH'' from the ''APIs to be used'' list.\nSubmitting
            this information shows us that you have a legal basis to use the MESH
            API. We''ll review the information you submit and respond within 5 to
            10 working days.\n\nIf we approve your request to use the MESH API, we''ll
            also email you a supplier pack within 10 working days. Read through this
            as it contains the testing requirements you''ll need to fulfil later on.\n\nYou
            should get your use case approved before you go too far with development.
            You can choose to proceed with your integration while you wait for approval,
            but you''ll be doing this at your own risk.\n\n [Sign in or create a developer
            account for digital onboarding](https://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk)\n\n\nYou
            will receive a response within 10 working days.\n\nIf you have been approved
            to use the MESH API, our assurance team will contact you via email with
            a supplier pack containing the testing requirements you will need to fulfill.
            You will work alongside this team to get your solution assured.\n\n###
            Request a mailbox\n\nOnce we''ve approved your request to use the MESH
            API, you''ll need to request a MESH Mailbox to use in a ''Path to Live
            integration environment''. This is how you''ll interact with the MESH
            API. A MESH Mailbox is secure and only your organisation can access it.\n\nTo
            request a MESH Mailbox, you''ll need to fill in an online form. It takes
            5 to 10 minutes to complete.\n\nYou''ll need to know:\n- your [ODS code](https://odsportal.digital.nhs.uk/)\n-
            the [workflow groups or IDs](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/workflow-groups-and-workflow-ids)
            for the files you plan to send or receive\n- the contact details of the
            person who will be managing the mailbox in your organisation\n\n[Request
            a ''Path to Live integration'' MESH Mailbox](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/messaging-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-apply-for-a-mailbox)\n\n###
            Receive your credentials for the ''Path to Live integration'' environment\n\nOnce
            you''ve requested a MESH Mailbox, we will email you your Mailbox ID and
            password within 5 working days. Keep these details safe as we''ll also
            ask you for this if you need help from our support teams.\n\nYou will
            also receive the shared secret. You''ll need to include this in the [MESH
            authorization header](#overview--mesh-authorization-header) when you develop
            this part of your software.\n\n### Get a TLS certificate\n\nYou''ll need
            a TLS certificate to establish a secure connection to MESH.\n\nHow to
            get a TLS certificate\n\n1. Generate a private key using your preferred
            method, with the naming convention cn=mailboxid.odscode.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk\n2.
            Generate a certificate signing request (CSR) based on the private key
            and your Mailbox ID.\n3. Email the CSR to [itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net](mailto:itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net)
            - this needs to contain the common name from your CSR ''Subject'' using
            the format local_id.ods_code.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk\n\nThe local_id is
            a local identifier such as a server name and ods_code is your ODS code,
            for example, SERVER001.X26.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk.\n\nOnce we receive
            your CSR, we''ll send you a TLS certificate within 5 working days.\n\nDepending
            on how you implement MESH API, you may also need to [download a RootCA
            and SubCA certificate](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/path-to-live-environments/integration-environment#rootca-and-subca-certificates).
            These are also required to establish a secure connection.\n\n### Develop
            and test your software\n\nNow that you have a MESH Mailbox for a ''Path
            to Live integration'' environment and a TLS certificate, start developing
            your software using the MESH API.\n\nWhen you''re ready to go live, you''ll
            need to:\n- request a TLS certificate for the production environment\n-
            request a MESH mailbox for the production environment\n- get a conformance
            certificate\n- sign a connection agreement\n\n### Submit non-functional
            requirements\n\nOnce you''ve developed your software, you''ll need to
            answer some questions in digital onboarding about the processes you use
            for:\n- handling data securely\n- managing clinical risk\n- using our
            production environment\n\nThis shows that your software meets our non-functional
            requirements.\n\n[Sign in to the digital onboarding to answer questions
            on ''non-functional'' requirements](https://identity.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/auth/realms/developer-identity/login-actions/authenticate?client_id=digital-onboarding-service&tab_id=YTe9EqJeUCc)\n\n###
            Demonstrate technical conformance\n\nBefore you can go live, in digital
            onboarding, you''ll need to:\n- answer some questions to show you conform
            to the technical requirements of our APIs\n- upload a conformance certificate\n\nTo
            get a technical conformance certificate, you''ll need to complete the
            testing requirements in the supplier pack we sent to you.\n\nSome of these
            tests have to be witnessed by us. To arrange a witness test, reply to
            the email that contains the supplier pack. The witness testing takes 2
            to 3 hours.\n\nIn some cases, we may ask you to prepare test data a few
            days before the day of the witness testing.\n\nWhen you''ve completed
            a witness test, we''ll email a technical conformance certificate to you
            within 5 working days. You can then upload it to digital onboarding.\n\n[Sign
            in to the digital onboarding to upload a technical conformance certificate](https://identity.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/auth/realms/developer-identity/login-actions/authenticate?client_id=digital-onboarding-service&tab_id=vYrgcflr9fs)\n\n###
            Get a MESH Mailbox for your live software\n\nWhen you''re ready to send
            or receive real data, you''ll need a MESH Mailbox in the production environment.
            We''ll ask to see the conformance certificate for your software before
            we issue this.\n\nMESH Mailboxes are specific to environments, this means
            you''ll need a different MESH Mailbox ID for each environment you use.\n\nTo
            request a MESH Mailbox, you''ll need to fill in an online form. It takes
            5 to 10 minutes to complete.\n\nYou''ll need to know:\n- your [ODS code](https://odsportal.digital.nhs.uk/)\n-
            the [workflow groups or IDs](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/workflow-groups-and-workflow-ids)
            for the files you plan to send or receive\n- the contact details of the
            person who will be managing the mailbox in your organisation\n\n[Request
            a ''Live'' MESH Mailbox](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/messaging-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-apply-for-a-mailbox)\n\n###
            Get a TLS certificate for the production environment\n\nOnce you have
            a Mailbox ID, you''ll need to get a TLS certificate. This allows you to
            establish a secure connection to MESH in the production environment.\n\nHow
            to get a TLS certificate\n1. Generate a private key using your preferred
            method, with the naming convention cn=mailboxid.odscode.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk\n2.
            Generate a CSR based on the private key and your Mailbox ID\n3. Email
            the CSR and technical conformance certificate to [ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.uk](mailto:ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.uk)
            - this needs to contain the common name from your CSR ''Subject'' using
            the format local_id.ods_code.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk\n\nThe local_id is
            a local identifier such as a server name and ods_code is your ODS code,
            for example, SERVER001.X26.api.mesh-client.nhs.uk.\n\nOnce we receive
            your CSR and technical conformance certificate, we''ll send you a TLS
            certificate for the production environment within 5 working days.\n\nDepending
            on how you implement MESH API, you may also need to [download a RootCA
            and SubCA certificate](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/path-to-live-environments/integration-environment#rootca-and-subca-certificates).
            These are also required to establish a secure connection.\n\n\n### Sign
            connection agreement\n\nYou''ll need to sign a connection agreement before
            your software can go live. Once you''ve signed it, you need to upload
            it to the ''Legal agreement'' section in digital onboarding. We''ll email
            your connection agreement to you within 5 working days of completing your
            witness test.\n\n[Sign in to the digital onboarding to upload your connection
            agreement](https://identity.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/auth/realms/developer-identity/login-actions/authenticate?client_id=digital-onboarding-service&tab_id=p19cQckpJso)\n\n###
            Go live with your software\n\nYou have now completed all integration and
            onboarding steps. This means you can use the MESH API with your live software.\n\n##

            Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request
            succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if it
            succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs
            to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client
            error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error
            on our server\n\nErrors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints
            section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes)

            Environments and testing\nThere are multiple externally accessible instances
            of MESH that can be used for testing, each with a different root URL.\n\n\n|

            different client TLS certificates.\n\nFor any questions about our testing
            environments, contact our support mailbox [itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net](mailto:itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net).\n\n###
            Develop against a local MESH sandbox server\nThere is a basic sandbox
            implementation of the MESH API available [mesh-sandbox](https://github.com/NHSDigital/mesh-sandbox).\n\nThis
            sandbox can be used for local development and currently does not require
            a client certificate\n\n## API Versioning\n\nMESH API now has `live-beta`
            support for versioning on certain endpoints in order to allow us to safely
            make new features and capabilities available to API consumers.\n\nMESH
            uses the `Accept` header to support different versions in the same API,
            sending a different `Accept` header will vary the response, refer to individual
            API endpoints for more detail.\n\nIf not specified `Accept: application/json`
            will be assumed and the lowest supported response version for that particular
            endpoint will be returned.\n\n**Note:** please refer to the table below
            for more detail on the status of a given API version.\n\n| Version | Accept                                               |
            Status |\n|---------|------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|
            1       | `application/json` or `application/vnd.mesh.v1+json` | live   |\n|
            2       | `application/vnd.mesh.v2+json`                       | live   |\n\n##
            MESH Authorization header\nRequests to the MESH API require an authorisation
            token in the HTTP `Authorization` header.\nTo be valid, the authorisation
            token must match the schema described below. The token includes cryptographic
            hashes of your organisation''s MESH mailbox password and the environment-wide
            shared secret.\nAs an additional security measure each token which matches
            the schema is valid for one request only, so you must generate a new token
            for every request. Any repeated use of a token results in a `403: Not
            Authorized` response from the MESH API.\n\nThe authorisation token is
            made up of six elements. Except for the first and second elements, each
            element is separated from the next by a colon (:).\n\n| Name          |
            Description                                                                                    |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|
            `NHSMESH`     | The name of the Custom Authentication Schema. The space
            at the end of the schema is important. |\n| `mailbox_id`  | The mailbox
            identifier sending the HTTP Request. Must be uppercase.                            |\n|
            `nonce`       | A GUID used as an encryption nonce.                                                            |\n|
            `nonce_count` | The number of times that the same nonce has been used.                                         |\n|
            `timestamp`   | The current UTC date and time in `yyyyMMddHHmm` format.                                        |\n|
            `hash`        | HMAC-SHA256 hash - see the list below.                                                         |\n\nThe
            `hash` is compiled of the following items:\n\n* The `shared_key` is the
            MESH environment shared secret, provided by [itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net](mailto:itoc.supportdesk@nhs.net)
            as part of onboarding to the PTL environment.\n* The `message` is the
            concatenation of the 5 following elements, joined by a colon (:):\n  -
            `mailbox_id`\n  - `nonce`\n  - `nonce_count`\n  - `mailbox_password`\n  -
            `timestamp`\n\nChanging the `nonce` and/or `nonce_count` elements between
            requests ensures the Authorization header is unique and valid.\n\n**Notes**\n-
            the API rejects the request if the `timestamp` supplied is not within
            2 hours of the server time\n- in the example below `SHARED_KEY` has been
            `[REDACTED_SHARED_KEY]`, this is the ''environment shared secret'' which
            you received as part of creating your mailbox\n- in the example below
            `MAILBOX_PASSWORD` has been `[REDACTED_PASSWORD]`, this is the ''mesh
            mailbox password'' which you received as part of creating your mailbox\n\n###
            Example implementation\nHere is an implementation of the above in `python3`.\n```python\n\"\"\"
            Python code to generate a valid authorization header. \"\"\"\nimport hmac\nimport
            uuid\nimport datetime\nfrom hashlib import sha256\n\nAUTH_SCHEMA_NAME
            = \"NHSMESH \"  # Note: Space at the end of the schema.\nSHARED_KEY =
            \"[REDACTED_SHARED_KEY]\"  # Note: Don''t hard code your passwords in
            a real implementation.\n\n\ndef build_auth_header(mailbox_id: str, password:
            str = \"password\",  nonce: str = None, nonce_count: int = 0):\n    \"\"\"
            Generate MESH Authorization header for mailboxid. \"\"\"\n    # Generate
            a GUID if required.\n    if not nonce:\n        nonce = str(uuid.uuid4())\n    #
            Current time formatted as yyyyMMddHHmm\n    # for example, 4th May 2020
            13:05 would be 202005041305\n    timestamp = datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime(\"%Y%m%d%H%M\")\n\n    #
            for example, NHSMESH AMP01HC001:bd0e2bd5-218e-41d0-83a9-73fdec414803:0:202005041305\n    hmac_msg
            = mailbox_id + \":\" + nonce + \":\" + str(nonce_count) + \":\" + password
            + \":\" + timestamp\n\n    # HMAC is a standard crypto hash method built
            in the python standard library.\n    hash_code = hmac.HMAC(SHARED_KEY.encode(),
            hmac_msg.encode(), sha256).hexdigest()\n    return (\n            AUTH_SCHEMA_NAME
            # Note: No colon between 1st and 2nd elements.\n            + mailbox_id
            + \":\"\n            + nonce + \":\"\n            + str(nonce_count) +
            \":\"\n            + timestamp+ \":\"\n            + hash_code\n    )\n\n\n#
            example usage\nMAILBOX_ID = \"X26AB1234\" # Note: Don''t hard code your
            mailbox id in a real implementation.\nMAILBOX_PASSWORD = \"[REDACTED_PASSWORD]\"  #
            Note: Don''t hard code your passwords in a real implementation.\n\n# send
            a new nonce each time\nprint(build_auth_header(MAILBOX_ID, MAILBOX_PASSWORD))\n\n#
            or reuse the nonce and increment the nonce_count\nmy_nonce = str(uuid.uuid4())\n\nprint(build_auth_header(MAILBOX_ID,
            MAILBOX_PASSWORD, my_nonce, nonce_count=1))\nprint(build_auth_header(MAILBOX_ID,
            MAILBOX_PASSWORD, my_nonce, nonce_count=2))\n\n\n```\n\n## MESH API pseudocode\nTo
            use MESH effectively, use the following flow of API calls:\n\n- inbox
            poll cycle\n- outbox workflow\n\nValidate your mailbox once every 24 hours
            using the ''Validate a mailbox'' endpoint.\n\n### Inbox poll cycle\nSpine
            gives each message a unique message identifier after you post it to your
            outbox. It is the primary identifier for the message during MESH transit.\n\nIt
            is suggested to poll your mailbox every 5 minutes, but at least every
            24 hours. The pseudocode for a mailbox poll is:\n\n1. Poll to get the
            messageIds of messages ready to download from the ''Check an inbox'' endpoint.\n2.
            For each message identifier returned in step 1:\n    * download the message
            with the ''Download message'' endpoint\n    * if it''s identified as a
            chunked message, download all remaining chunks with the ''Download message
            chunk'' endpoint\n    * acknowledge receipt of the message via the ''Acknowledge
            message'' endpoint\n3. Repeat step 2 until you have processed the number
            of messages returned in step 1.\n4. If you received exactly 500 messages
            in step 1 then repeat from step 1, immediately polling again and downloading,
            until you receive 0 messages in step 1.\n\n### Asynchronous error reporting\nMost
            problems with message transfer are indicated synchronously (immediately)
            when you call the ''Send Message'' endpoint. However, some errors might
            occur after a successful request (asynchronously). You get any error reports
            as messages in your inbox, which you need to receive as part of your inbox
            poll cycle.\nError reports differ from regular messages in these ways:\n-
            the ''Download message endpoint'' has a different value for the `Mex-MessageType`
            header:\n  * DATA for a normal organisation-to-organisation message\n  *
            REPORT for an error report\n- the Download message response body of an
            error report message is empty\n\nWe strongly recommend you check the value
            of `Mex-MessageType` after downloading each message, so that you can take
            appropriate action if needed.\n\n| Error Report Header     | Description                                                              |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

            Outbox workflow\nThe maximum amount of data allowed by MESH in a single
            request message is 100MB. You can send larger messages by breaking them
            into \\\"chunks\\\" that are transmitted as a single message over multiple
            requests. The upper limit of a single chunked message is 100GB (20GB if
            using the java client).\n\nThe [MESH UI](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/compare-mesh-services#mesh-user-interface)
            and older versions of the MESH client do not support chunking. Check that
            the receiver''s interface to MESH for your workflow identifier handles
            chunked messages prior to sending. To do this:\n\n1. Determine the size
            of your message data (after compression) with a standard algorithm (such
            as `gzip`). If the compressed message is larger than 100MB, is smaller
            than 100GB, and the receiving mailbox / workflow identifier supports chunking,
            then you can send a chunked message. To prepare for this:\n    *  split
            the **uncompressed** data into ordered chunks\n    * **independently**
            compress each chunk with the **same** compression algorithm (such as `gzip`)
            such that each chunk is smaller than 100MB\n    * use the first chunk
            (after compression) as the initial message data\n2. Send a message with
            appropriate workflow identifier and `Mex-To` (recipient mailbox) header.
            To do this:\n    * optionally include a local identifier from step 2 for
            tracking.  This field must not contain PID.\n    * if sending a chunked
            message, include an extra header to indicate that this is the first in
            a series of chunks, then submit the subsequent chunks via the ''Send Chunked
            Message'' endpoint\n3. A message identifier will be returned which is
            the unique identifier and can be used for tracking and helping with incident
            resolution. It would be good practice to log this identifier.\n\n### Message
            expiration\nMessages that are not downloaded and acknowledged within five
            days of delivery are removed from your inbox. The sending organisation
            receives an error report explaining that the receiver did not collect
            the message. Uncollected messages are completely deleted from the MESH
            server 30 days after the initial delivery. If the sending organisation
            cannot re-send the message within the intervening time, it may contact
            our [national service desk](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support)
            with the error report details and ask for the message to be placed in
            your inbox again.\n\n## Onboarding\n\nYou need to get your software approved
            by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The
            onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it''s worth planning
            well ahead.\n\nTo understand how our online digital onboarding process
            works, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding).
            This is where you can demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your
            software conforms technically with the requirements for this API. You
            can also manage onboarding for other APIs in your account.\n\n<div class=\"nhsd-m-emphasis-box

            Overview\nUse this endpoint to send a message via MESH. Use the POST command
            to your virtual outbox. Specify the message recipient in the request headers,
            with the message contained in the request body.\n\n### Messages larger
            than 100MB\n100MB (20MB on internet) is the largest data payload the MESH
            API accepts in a single request. Compress larger messages to reduce bandwidth
            and data storage on Spine. If compression does not sufficiently reduce
            the message size enough for transmission in a single request then you
            can break it up into smaller chunks and transmit them separately provided:\n  1.  The
            total compressed size of the message is < 100MB - this is the Spine upper
            limit for a single message.\n  2.  The receiver mailbox and workflow identifier
            support the downloading of chunked messages. MESH UI and older versions
            of the MESH client do not support this.\n\nTo correctly break the outbound
            message into valid chunks:\n  1.  Split the **uncompressed** message into
            `n` ordered chunks such that each (compressed) chunk is smaller than 20MB.\n  2.  **Independently**
            compress each chunk with the same compression algorithm (e.g. `gzip`).\n  3.  The
            first (compressed) chunk of the message should be transmitted using this
            endpoint (the normal send message endpoint). Include the optional `Mex-Chunk-Range`
            header with a value `1:n` to tell Spine that this is a chunked message
            and to wait for `n-1` other requests before delivering the message. The
            message identifier of this initial server response **must** be captured
            as it is a required path element of the Send chunked message URL.\n\nAlways
            set the workflow identifier as some workflows are restricted which means
            the mailbox sender and recipient must be configured for the workflow identifier
            you send.\n\nTo discover the recipient mailbox either use the `endpointlookup`
            endpoint or for certain workflows you can include [demographic details](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh/mesh-guidance-hub/endpoint-lookup-service-and-workflowids#using-the-to_dts-field-of-a-mesh-message-to-find-a-mailbox-)
            in the `Mex-To` field.\n\nIt is good practice to capture the returned
            message identifier as this provides a unique identifier which you can
            use for message tracking.\n\n### Request\n\n```shell\ncurl -k \\\n--request

            Overview\nUse this endpoint to send a chunked message. The ''Send Message''
            endpoint has a maximum single request message payload size of 100MB over
            HSCN or 20MB over the internet. However, you can send much larger messages
            (up to 20GB) by breaking up the message into chunks and transmitting it
            over multiple requests.\n\n**Note**: Some workflow ids do not support
            chunking because it is not currently supported in the MESH UI and older
            versions of the MESH client. Check with your receiving organisation before
            sending messages with this endpoint.\n\nTo send a chunked message:\n\n1.
            Split it into separate files\n2. Compress the individual chunks **separately**
            with the **same** compression program (e.g. `gzip`).\n   - **DO NOT**
            compress a large file and then split the compressed version\n3. Upload
            the first file using the normal ''Send message'' endpoint.\n   - include
            the `Mex-Chunk-Range` header with a value of `1:n` where `n` is the number
            of separate files your big data is split into\n   - capture the message
            identifier field in the returned JSON\n4. Upload subsequent files in the
            correct order using the chunked message endpoint\n\n**Note:** fewer headers
            are required for the chunked message endpoint because Spine uses the relevant
            metadata from the initial (`Mex-Chunk-Header=1:n`) call to the ''Send
            message'' endpoint.\n\n### Request\n\nSuppose Bob has a large file to
            send to Alice. In this example we will use **message.txt**. It is easily
            small enough to send in a single request, but we will chunk it anyway
            to illustrate the API calls.\n```shell\nls -sh message.txt\n4.0kb message.txt\n```\n```shell\ncat
            message.txt\n\nHi Alice,\n\nThis is Bob. It''s really nice that we can
            communicate via SPINE!\n\nI hope to hear more from you in the future,\n\nBob.\n```\n\n  First
            we break up our one \"large\" file into two smaller files. We will transmit
            one per request.\n\n```shell\nsplit -b 100 message.txt message.txt_\nls
            -sh message.txt_*\n```\n\nLarge messages should be compressed to reduce
            the bandwidth and storage requirements for Spine.\n```shell\nfor chunk_file
            in message.txt_*; do\n  gzip -k -f $chunk_file;\ndone\nls -sh message.txt_*.gz\n\n4.0kb
            message.txt_aa.gz\n4.0kb message.txt_ab.gz\n```\n```shell\ncurl -k \\\n--cacert

                  <p>MESH can send all types of data.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Rename the data you wish to send as a '.dat' file. To do this you can either:</p>

                  <ul>
                   <li>add the '.dat' extension after the original file type or</li>
                   <li>remove the original file type extension and replace it with '.dat'</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>For example, you may have an comma seperated file (CSV) file that you wish to send. You can either use a double file extension such as xxxx.csv.dat or a single file extension such as xxxx.dat. With the double file extension, your recipient need to remove the '.dat' to successfully open the file. With the single file extension, the recipient will need to know what programme to open the data file with, as there is no indication from the file name what type of data is contained.</p>

                  <p>Unless your recipient expresses a preference, you are normally better to use the double file extension.</p>

                  <p>Note: Be aware of the 'General Data Protection Rules' (GDPR) regulations and how they apply to the sending of personal information.

                  <p>The <code class="codeinline">&lt;Subject&gt;</code> section is optional. It acts like an email subject header, so you may use this to explain to the recipient what the message is about, name a specific member of staff for the recipient mailbox’s information, or what the message contains. You may leave this blank if you wish.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The <code class="codeinline">&lt;LocalId&gt;</code> section is an optional field. You can specify any reference or information which is useful to you, but take care not to include personal identifiable data (PID) such as names, addresses and so on. This section can also be used for message tracking.</p>

                  <p>The <code class="codeinline">&lt;Compress&gt;</code> section is to indicate that the data file can be compressed by the MESH client. Put 'Y' if you wish to compress the data file, or an 'N' if you do not want it compressed.</p>

                  <p>If another organisation has sent your mailbox a message, it will be saved to your 'in' folder. There may be a delay in between the sending and receiving of a file, depending on the configuration of your MESH client, and the sender’s.</p>

                  <p>To access the message, double-click on the file to open it. If the data file has a double file extension (for example, xxxx.csv.dat), rename the file to remove the '.dat' (for example, xxx.csv), and the file will open automatically.</p>

                  <p>MESH makes the messages from the server unavailable five days after they have been sent. You should fetch new messages from the server frequently, as the default MESH client does not send a notification for a new message. If you fail to collect a message after five days, a non-delivery message will be sent to the original sender, and the recipient’s message will be deleted. It is possible for us to resend this message within 30 days of being sent if you contact the National Service Desk at <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="mailto:ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.net"><u>ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.net</u></a>.</p>

                   <ul>
                    <li>Create a folder where you can save '.dat' files you wish to send.</li>
                    <li>Create a script to detect the new '.dat' file in your new folder.</li>
                    <li>Use the <code class="codeinline">mailbox ID</code> used in the saved '.dat' file’s name and automatically create the '.ctl' file required using a template.</li>

                  <p>MESH can send all types of data.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Rename the data you wish to send as a '.dat' file. To do this you can either:</p>

                  <ul>
                   <li>add the '.dat' extension after the original file type or</li>
                   <li>remove the original file type extension and replace it with '.dat'</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>For example, you may have an comma seperated file (CSV) file that you wish to send. You can either use a double file extension such as xxxx.csv.dat or a single file extension such as xxxx.dat. With the double file extension, your recipient need to remove the '.dat' to successfully open the file. With the single file extension, the recipient will need to know what programme to open the data file with, as there is no indication from the file name what type of data is contained.</p>

                  <p>Unless your recipient expresses a preference, you are normally better to use the double file extension.</p>

                  <p>Note: Be aware of the 'General Data Protection Rules' (GDPR) regulations and how they apply to the sending of personal information.

                  <p>The <code class="codeinline">&lt;Subject&gt;</code> section is optional. It acts like an email subject header, so you may use this to explain to the recipient what the message is about, name a specific member of staff for the recipient mailbox’s information, or what the message contains. You may leave this blank if you wish.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The <code class="codeinline">&lt;LocalId&gt;</code> section is an optional field. You can specify any reference or information which is useful to you, but take care not to include personal identifiable data (PID) such as names, addresses and so on. This section can also be used for message tracking.</p>

                  <p>The <code class="codeinline">&lt;Compress&gt;</code> section is to indicate that the data file can be compressed by the MESH client. Put 'Y' if you wish to compress the data file, or an 'N' if you do not want it compressed.</p>

                  <p>If another organisation has sent your mailbox a message, it will be saved to your 'in' folder. There may be a delay in between the sending and receiving of a file, depending on the configuration of your MESH client, and the sender’s.</p>

                  <p>To access the message, double-click on the file to open it. If the data file has a double file extension (for example, xxxx.csv.dat), rename the file to remove the '.dat' (for example, xxx.csv), and the file will open automatically.</p>

                  <p>MESH makes the messages from the server unavailable five days after they have been sent. You should fetch new messages from the server frequently, as the default MESH client does not send a notification for a new message. If you fail to collect a message after five days, a non-delivery message will be sent to the original sender, and the recipient’s message will be deleted. It is possible for us to resend this message within 30 days of being sent if you contact the National Service Desk at <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="mailto:ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.net"><u>ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.net</u></a>.</p>

                   <ul>
                    <li>Create a folder where you can save '.dat' files you wish to send.</li>
                    <li>Create a script to detect the new '.dat' file in your new folder.</li>
                    <li>Use the <code class="codeinline">mailbox ID</code> used in the saved '.dat' file’s name and automatically create the '.ctl' file required using a template.</li>
                    <li>Finally copy both the '.ctl' and '.dat' file to the MESH Mailbox 'out' folder.</li>

                  <p>MESH can send all types of data.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Rename the data you wish to send as a '.dat' file. To do this you can either:</p>

                  <ul>
                   <li>add the '.dat' extension after the original file type or</li>
                   <li>remove the original file type extension and replace it with '.dat'</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>For example, you may have an comma seperated file (CSV) file that you wish to send. You can either use a double file extension such as xxxx.csv.dat or a single file extension such as xxxx.dat. With the double file extension, your recipient need to remove the '.dat' to successfully open the file. With the single file extension, the recipient will need to know what programme to open the data file with, as there is no indication from the file name what type of data is contained.</p>

                  <p>Unless your recipient expresses a preference, you are normally better to use the double file extension.</p>

                  <p>The <code class="codeinline">&lt;WorkflowID&gt;</code> section should be the name of the correct 'workflow ID' described in the email received when your mailbox was first created.</p>

If you do not know what this is, ask your recipient directly for their MESH mailbox name. Otherwise, refer to the MESH endpoint lookup service page for guidance on finding a mailbox name.</p>

                  <p>Note: Be aware of the 'General Data Protection Rules' (GDPR) regulations and how they apply to the sending of personal information. We recommend that you establish the correct workflow ID with your recipient (rather than relying on a search to find the correct mailbox name).</p>

                  <p>The <code class="codeinline">&lt;FromDTS&gt;</code> section should be the name of your mailbox ID, included on the email received when your mailbox was first created.</p>

                  <p>The <code class="codeinline">&lt;Subject&gt;</code> section is optional. It acts like an email subject header, so you may use this to explain to the recipient what the message is about, name a specific member of staff for the recipient mailbox’s information, or what the message contains. You may leave this blank if you wish.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>The <code class="codeinline">&lt;LocalId&gt;</code> section is an optional field. You can specify any reference or information which is useful to you, but take care not to include personal identifiable data (PID) such as names, addresses and so on. This section can also be used for message tracking.</p>

                  <p>The <code class="codeinline">&lt;Compress&gt;</code> section is to indicate that the data file can be compressed by the MESH client. Put 'Y' if you wish to compress the data file, or an 'N' if you do not want it compressed.</p>

                  <p>If another organisation has sent your mailbox a message, it will be saved to your 'in' folder. There may be a delay in between the sending and receiving of a file, depending on the configuration of your MESH client, and the sender’s.</p>

                  <p>To access the message, double-click on the file to open it. If the data file has a double file extension (for example, xxxx.csv.dat), rename the file to remove the '.dat' (for example, xxx.csv), and the file will open automatically.</p>

                  <p>MESH makes the messages from the server unavailable five days after they have been sent. You should fetch new messages from the server frequently, as the default MESH client does not send a notification for a new message. If you fail to collect a message after five days, a non-delivery message will be sent to the original sender, and the recipient’s message will be deleted. It is possible for us to resend this message within 30 days of being sent if you contact the National Service Desk at <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="mailto:ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.net"><u>ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.net</u></a>.</p>

                  <p>You can change the set up of a MESH mailbox to make it more efficient. These changes require someone to edit the configuration of the MESH client, so ask your IT department about implementing these changes:</p>

                   <li>Message received notification:<br />
                   create a script that monitors the 'in' folder for new files and sends an email to people that need to know.</li>
                   <li>Automatically send a message from the '.dat' file only:
                   <ul>
                    <li>Create a folder where you can save '.dat' files you wish to send.</li>
                    <li>Create a script to detect the new '.dat' file in your new folder.</li>
                    <li>Use the <code class="codeinline">mailbox ID</code> used in the saved '.dat' file’s name and automatically create the '.ctl' file required using a template.</li>
                    <li>Finally copy both the '.ctl' and '.dat' file to the MESH Mailbox 'out' folder.</li>

                <p>As part of&nbsp;this process, you need to demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your software conforms technically with the requirements for this API. This might impact the design of your software. For details, see&nbsp;<a href="onboarding-support-information">NEMS FHIR API onboarding support information</a>.</p>

                </ul>

                <p>There is a testing tool which allows you to simulate a provider publishing event messages. You can also simulate making&nbsp;changes on PDS to trigger PDS-published event messages so you can test event message consumption.</p>
