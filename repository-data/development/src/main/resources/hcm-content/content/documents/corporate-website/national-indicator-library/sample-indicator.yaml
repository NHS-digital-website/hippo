      /nationalindicatorlibrary:purpose:
        hippostd:content: <p>Patients who have had a stroke should be admitted directly
          to a specialist acute stroke unit. Getting patients to a stroke unit quickly
          is a strong indicator of eventual outcomes and is also closely linked to
          improved quality of care across other stroke care markers. The indicator
          is therefore an important measure of the effectiveness of recognition and
          assessment of the symptoms of stroke, and the process to transfer people
          to a stroke unit in a timely manner. Patients who have a stroke in hospital
          are included in the indicator to take into account the process of recognising
          the stroke has occurred and the systems in place for in-hospital pathways.</p>
