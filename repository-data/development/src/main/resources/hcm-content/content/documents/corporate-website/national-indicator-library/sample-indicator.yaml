    nationalindicatorlibrary:definition: "The percentage of people with stroke admitted\

      \ = Intensive Treatment Unit, CCU = Critical Care Unit, HDU = High Dependency\

      \ was ITU, CCU or HDU), the percentage whose first ward of admission is a stroke\
      \ unit AND who arrive on the stroke unit within 4 hours of arrival at hospital\
      \ (except for those patients who were already in hospital at the time of new\
      \ stroke occurrence, who should instead be admitted to a stroke unit within\
      \ 4 hours of onset of stroke symptoms).\r\n\r\nStroke is defined within this\
      \ indicator as intracerebral haemorrhage (ICD-10 code: I61), cerebral infarction\
      \ (I63) and stroke, not specified as haemorrhage or infarction (I64).\r\n\r\n\
      The indicator is published annually in December for each CCG in England. It\
      \ was published for the first time in December 2014 (2013/14 data)."
    nationalindicatorlibrary:denominator: All patients admitted to hospital with a
      primary diagnosis of stroke, except for those whose first ward of admission
      was Intensive Treatment Unit (ITU), Critical Care Unit (CCU) or High Dependency
      Unity (HDU).

    nationalindicatorlibrary:interpretationGuidelines: "A high percentage of patients\
      \ with stroke admitted to an acute stroke unit within 4 hours of arrival to\
      \ hospital is desirable.\r\n\r\nThis indicator acknowledges that for a small\
      \ percentage of patients direct admission to a stroke unit is not appropriate.\
      \ It differentiates between those who go to an acceptable other location (i.e.\
      \ people transferred to intensive care are excluded from the indicator) compared\
      \ to a ‘non acceptable’ location (e.g. generic admissions unit).\r\n\r\nThis\
      \ indicator requires careful interpretation and should not be viewed in isolation,\
      \ but instead be considered alongside information from other indicators and\
      \ alternative sources, such as CCG OIS 3.9 (People who have had an acute stroke\
      \ who spend 90% or more of their stay on a stroke unit) and the CCG level SSNAP\
      \ stroke unit key indicators. When evaluated together, these will help to provide\
      \ a holistic view of CCG outcomes and provide a more complete overview of the\
      \ impact of the CCGs’ processes on outcomes."
    nationalindicatorlibrary:numerator: Of the denominator, the number of patients
      whose first ward of admission is a stroke unit AND who are admitted to the stroke
      unit within 4 hours of arrival at hospital, except for those patients who were
      already in hospital at the time of new stroke occurrence, who are admitted to
      a stroke unit within 4 hours of onset of stroke symptoms.
    nationalindicatorlibrary:publishedBy: ''
    nationalindicatorlibrary:purpose: Patients who have had a stroke should be admitted
      directly to a specialist acute stroke unit. Getting patients to a stroke unit
      quickly is a strong indicator of eventual outcomes and is also closely linked
      to improved quality of care across other stroke care markers. The indicator
      is therefore an important measure of the effectiveness of recognition and assessment
      of the symptoms of stroke, and the process to transfer people to a stroke unit
      in a timely manner. Patients who have a stroke in hospital are included in the
      indicator to take into account the process of recognising the stroke has occurred
      and the systems in place for in-hospital pathways.
