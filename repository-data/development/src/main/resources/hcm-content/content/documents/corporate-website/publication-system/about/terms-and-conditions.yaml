        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to access certain content, systems or interactive features on this website you may be asked to choose, or be provided with, a password or other log in details to access parts of this website. As a minimum, passwords you set for use with this website must have a level of complexity which ensures they cannot be easily guessed by hackers or malicious software.&nbsp; They should:</p>

        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <ul>
         <li>be at least twelve characters long;</li>
         <li>not contain your user name, real name, or organisation name;</li>
         <li>not appear in the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.passwordrandom.com/most-popular-passwords">list of top 10,000 passwords</a>;</li>
         <li>not use sequential key characters on the keyboard (e.g. qwerty, asdfg, 12345)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0">Government best practice</a>, we recommend using the ‘three random words’ approach, which uses three or more randomly chosen words like ‘saloonbadgertree’ or ‘coffeetrainfish’.&nbsp; These words should be random, and not related personally to you (so not involving a favourite thing, holiday, relative). Passwords must not under any circumstances be shared with anyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to access certain content, systems or interactive features on this website you may be asked to choose, or be provided with, a password or other log in details to access parts of this website. As a minimum, passwords you set for use with this website must have a level of complexity which ensures they cannot be easily guessed by hackers or malicious software.&nbsp; They should:</p>

        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <ul>
         <li>be at least twelve characters long;</li>
         <li>not contain your user name, real name, or organisation name;</li>
         <li>not appear in the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.passwordrandom.com/most-popular-passwords">list of top 10,000 passwords</a>;</li>
         <li>not use sequential key characters on the keyboard (e.g. qwerty, asdfg, 12345)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0">Government best practice</a>, we recommend using the ‘three random words’ approach, which uses three or more randomly chosen words like ‘saloonbadgertree’ or ‘coffeetrainfish’.&nbsp; These words should be random, and not related personally to you (so not involving a favourite thing, holiday, relative). Passwords must not under any circumstances be shared with anyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NHS Digital is under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive services we provide from this website, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of these interactive services by a user in contravention of these terms and conditions, whether the service is moderated or not.</p>

        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p>10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our RSS feeds can be used as part of your website; however, we do require that proper format and attribution are used. The attribution text should read “<strong>NHS Digital</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>RSS feeds</strong>”. We reserve the right from time to time to restrict the distribution of NHS Digital RSS feed content and do not accept any liability for these feeds.</p>

        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p>10.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of our social bookmarking links is subject to these terms and conditions, see ‘Linking from this website’ below.</p>

        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p>10.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although we do monitor and review discussions, chat, postings, transmissions, bulletin boards and the like on this website and its subsections, we are under no obligation to do so and assume no responsibility or liability arising from the content of any such locations nor for any error, omission, infringement, defamation, obscenity, or inaccuracy contained in any information within such locations on this website.</p>

Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them. Where we do moderate any of the interactive features on this website, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.</p>

        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to access certain content, systems or interactive features on this website you may be asked to choose, or be provided with, a password or other log in details to access parts of this website. As a minimum, passwords you set for use with this website must have a level of complexity which ensures they cannot be easily guessed by hackers or malicious software.&nbsp; They should:</p>

        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <ul>
         <li>be at least twelve characters long;</li>
         <li>not contain your user name, real name, or organisation name;</li>
         <li>not appear in the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.passwordrandom.com/most-popular-passwords">list of top 10,000 passwords</a>;</li>
         <li>not use sequential key characters on the keyboard (e.g. qwerty, asdfg, 12345)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0">Government best practice</a>, we recommend using the ‘three random words’ approach, which uses three or more randomly chosen words like ‘saloonbadgertree’ or ‘coffeetrainfish’.&nbsp; These words should be random, and not related personally to you (so not involving a favourite thing, holiday, relative). Passwords must not under any circumstances be shared with anyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

You warrant that any such contribution does comply with those standards, and you indemnify us for any breach of that warranty.</p>

You warrant that all statements of fact in any comment you submit are true, and that any expression of opinion is your honestly held opinion on those facts, or that of the person on whose behalf you are writing.</p>

        <p>10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our RSS feeds can be used as part of your website; however, we do require that proper format and attribution are used.

        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
