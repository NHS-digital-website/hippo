            <p>The Clinical Commissioning Group Outcomes Indicator Set (CCG OIS) is an integral part of NHS England’s systematic approach to quality improvement. Its primary aim is to support and enable CCGs and health and wellbeing partners to plan for health improvement by providing information for measuring and benchmarking outcomes of services commissioned by CCGs. It is also intended to provide clear, comparative information for patients and the public about the quality of health services commissioned by CCGs and the associated health outcomes.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The CCG Outcomes Indicator Set uses the registered patient population of England as its subject population, and where standardisation is required, the Office for National Statistics mid-year population estimates for England. All indicators are reported at CCG and National level, where 'National' represents the sum total of patients registered with a GP in England.</p>

            <p>The NHS Outcomes Framework uses the ONS mid-year population estimates for England as its subject population, and where standardisation is required the European Standard Population is generally used. All indicators are reported at England level, and are broken down, where possible, by a combination of Age, Lower tier local authority, Upper tier local authority, Region, Religion, Ethnicity, Deprivation decile, Sexual orientation, Gender and Condition.</p>

            <p>The indicators are structured around the five NHS Outcomes Framework domains.</p>

            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
             <li><strong>Domain 1, Preventing people from dying prematurely</strong>&nbsp;<br />
             This domain captures how successful the NHS is in reducing the number of avoidable deaths.</li>
             <li><strong>Domain 2, Enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions</strong>&nbsp;<br />
             This domain captures how successfully the NHS is supporting people with long-term conditions to live as normal a life as possible.</li>
             <li><strong>Domain 3, Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury</strong>&nbsp;<br />
             This domain captures how people recover from ill health or injury and wherever possible how it can be prevented.</li>
             <li><strong>Domain 4, Ensuring that people have a positive experience of care</strong>&nbsp;<br />
             This domain looks at the importance of providing a positive experience of care for patients, service users and carers.</li>
             <li><strong>Domain 5, Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm</strong>&nbsp;<br />
             This domain explores patient safety and its importance in terms of quality of care to deliver better health outcomes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Background</strong></p>

            <p>In October 2011 this collection of indicators brought together information that was previously available on two different websites; the Compendium of Clinical and Health Indicators and the Local Basket of Inequalities Indicators.</p>

            <p>If you previously used the Compendium of Clinical and Health Indicators website (also known as NCHOD) then please be aware that the Directory of Clinical Databases (DoCDat) and Patient Reported Outcome Measures Group resources are now located on other websites.</p>

            <p>For information about the contents of the Local Basket of Indicators please select the appropriate link from the list on the left.</p>

            <p><strong>What do the indicators cover?</strong></p>

            <p>There are over 1,000 indicators in this collection. They cover the following areas of interest:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>Population and demography</li>
             <li>Births, conceptions, fertility, abortions</li>
             <li>Deaths, mortality, infant mortality and life expectancy</li>
             <li>Cancer screening, incidence, survival and death rates</li>
             <li>Circulatory and heart diseases</li>
             <li>Respiratory diseases</li>
             <li>Diabetes and other long term conditions</li>
             <li>Infectious diseases and immunisation</li>
             <li>Health status</li>
             <li>Lifestyle e.g. nutrition, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity</li>
             <li>Health interventions and Primary Care</li>
             <li>Hospital care</li>
             <li>Home and Community support</li>
             <li>Socio-economic factors influencing health
             <ul>
              <li>Employment, poverty, homelessness, deprivation, crime</li>
              <li>Education</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
            </ul>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The indicators can be viewed on a national basis and at a number of different regional and local levels including Strategic Health Authority, Primary Care Trust/Organisation, Region and Local Authority. Please note that not all indicators can be viewed at every level.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Access to the Compendium</strong></p>

            <p>This website (<a href="https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/" target="_blank">https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk</a>) is available for any user.</p>

            <p>If you are having difficulty finding what you need please contact us via&nbsp;<a href="mailto:enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk?subject=Indicator%20Portal">enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk</a>&nbsp;for help with your data requirement.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>How can I access the archive?</strong></p>

            <p>We have an archive of older Compendium files (going back very many years) which are available on request.</p>

            <p>Please use the "contact us" button on the top right and specify which indicator files you are interested in, and for which time periods. We will do our best to assist.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Classification and Search features</strong></p>

            <p>The Indicator Portal is hosting a number of indicators in addition to the Compendium e.g. SHMI. Users will be able to search across the entire portal and access all indicators for a subject.</p>

            <p>The indicators have been classified according to subject rather than type of indicator e.g. mortality / prevalence / incidence. This ensures that all indicators are classified in a consistent manner and a user browsing around a subject grouping will have access to other types of indicators outside of the Compendium.</p>

            <p>Further indicators will be added to the portal which may not necessarily be of a specific indicator type and designing the taxonomy around subject included them all.&nbsp; The portal enables keyword searching to support the user who is interested in specific attributes, for example indicator type. A user can therefore enter a search on 'mortality' and a list of all the mortality indicators will be returned, likewise a search on 'prevalence' would bring up all the prevalence indicators. Searches can be refined by adding key words e.g. "vaccination MMR".</p>

            <p>However, if you continue to experience difficulty finding what you need please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk?subject=Indicator%20Portal">contact us</a>&nbsp;for help with your data requirement.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>User Engagement and changes to functionality</strong></p>

            <p>Through the Compendium Advisory Group, that has representation from the NHS and DH, we have kept stakeholders involved in changes to the Compendium.</p>

            <p>The indicators have not been significantly reviewed for over six years and NHS Digital conducted an initial 6 month review on the Compendium in early 2012. The aim was to help shape strategy and direct the work in NHS Digital in developing the Compendium of Public Health Indicators products and services to meet changing customer demand. Through an online survey and telephone interviews, stakeholders and users were asked about their experience of using the Compendium and views on future data requirements.</p>

            <p>In response to users' comments a number of initial changes have been made:</p>

            <p><strong>• Improved keywords</strong></p>

            <p>The content of the current keyword database has been extensively reviewed. The aim was to improve the search function by increasing the number of keywords tagged. This should improve indicator access and reduce navigation time.</p>

            <p><strong>• Indicator List</strong></p>

            <p>To aid users in finding indicators there is a full indicator list, which can be downloaded, on the Indicator Portal homepage and on the Compendium homepage. This covers all indicators and not just those on the Compendium.</p>

            <p>From this list, users can filter on:-</p>

            <ul>
             <li>Indicator Portal code</li>
             <li>Indicator group (e.g. Compendium)</li>
             <li>Level 1 (e.g. Hospital care)</li>
             <li>Level 2 (e.g. Admissions)</li>
             <li>Indicator name</li>
             <li>Release date</li>
             <li>Next update expected</li>
            </ul>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This indicator list has also been added to the section called 'Site Updates' on the Indicator Portal homepage, under the heading 'Indicator Portal news' which provides the release history of indicators- date, title and description.&nbsp;<a href="https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/webview/velocity?mode=documentation&amp;submode=catalog&amp;catalog=https%3A%2F%2F192.168.228.51%3A443%2Fobj%2FfCatalog%2FCatalog9" target="_blank">Site Updates</a></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Extra Guidance</strong></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Extra guidance for users on how to filter the indicator list and search is provided through the screenshot guide on the main page of the Indicator Portal.</p>

            <p><a href="https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/download/Indicator_Portal_userguide.pdf" target="_blank">http://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/download/Indicator_Portal_userguide.pdf</a></p>

            <p>User feedback will be used to prioritise other developments over the next 12 months and we continue to seek such feedback on the recent changes to the Indicator Portal.</p>

            <p>Users are also advised to utilise the following sections:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>Additional reading</li>

            <p><strong>Background</strong></p>

            <p>In October 2011 this collection of indicators brought together information that was previously available on two different websites; the Compendium of Clinical and Health Indicators and the Local Basket of Inequalities Indicators.</p>

            <p>If you previously used the Compendium of Clinical and Health Indicators website (also known as NCHOD) then please be aware that the Directory of Clinical Databases (DoCDat) and Patient Reported Outcome Measures Group resources are now located on other websites.</p>

            <p>For information about the contents of the Local Basket of Indicators please select the appropriate link from the list on the left.</p>

            <p><strong>What do the indicators cover?</strong></p>

            <p>There are over 1,000 indicators in this collection. They cover the following areas of interest:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>Population and demography</li>
             <li>Births, conceptions, fertility, abortions</li>
             <li>Deaths, mortality, infant mortality and life expectancy</li>
             <li>Cancer screening, incidence, survival and death rates</li>
             <li>Circulatory and heart diseases</li>
             <li>Respiratory diseases</li>
             <li>Diabetes and other long term conditions</li>
             <li>Infectious diseases and immunisation</li>
             <li>Health status</li>
             <li>Lifestyle e.g. nutrition, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity</li>
             <li>Health interventions and Primary Care</li>
             <li>Hospital care</li>
             <li>Home and Community support</li>
             <li>Socio-economic factors influencing health
             <ul>
              <li>Employment, poverty, homelessness, deprivation, crime</li>
              <li>Education</li>
             </ul>
             </li>
            </ul>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The indicators can be viewed on a national basis and at a number of different regional and local levels including Strategic Health Authority, Primary Care Trust/Organisation, Region and Local Authority. Please note that not all indicators can be viewed at every level.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Access to the Compendium</strong></p>

            <p>This website (<a href="https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/" target="_blank">https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk</a>) is available for any user.</p>

            <p>If you are having difficulty finding what you need please contact us via&nbsp;<a href="mailto:enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk?subject=Indicator%20Portal">enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk</a>&nbsp;for help with your data requirement.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>How can I access the archive?</strong></p>

            <p>We have an archive of older Compendium files (going back very many years) which are available on request.</p>

            <p>Please use the "contact us" button on the top right and specify which indicator files you are interested in, and for which time periods. We will do our best to assist.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Classification and Search features</strong></p>

            <p>The Indicator Portal is hosting a number of indicators in addition to the Compendium e.g. SHMI. Users will be able to search across the entire portal and access all indicators for a subject.</p>

            <p>The indicators have been classified according to subject rather than type of indicator e.g. mortality / prevalence / incidence. This ensures that all indicators are classified in a consistent manner and a user browsing around a subject grouping will have access to other types of indicators outside of the Compendium.</p>

            <p>Further indicators will be added to the portal which may not necessarily be of a specific indicator type and designing the taxonomy around subject included them all.&nbsp; The portal enables keyword searching to support the user who is interested in specific attributes, for example indicator type. A user can therefore enter a search on 'mortality' and a list of all the mortality indicators will be returned, likewise a search on 'prevalence' would bring up all the prevalence indicators. Searches can be refined by adding key words e.g. "vaccination MMR".</p>

            <p>However, if you continue to experience difficulty finding what you need please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk?subject=Indicator%20Portal">contact us</a>&nbsp;for help with your data requirement.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>User Engagement and changes to functionality</strong></p>

            <p>Through the Compendium Advisory Group, that has representation from the NHS and DH, we have kept stakeholders involved in changes to the Compendium.</p>

            <p>The indicators have not been significantly reviewed for over six years and NHS Digital conducted an initial 6 month review on the Compendium in early 2012. The aim was to help shape strategy and direct the work in NHS Digital in developing the Compendium of Public Health Indicators products and services to meet changing customer demand. Through an online survey and telephone interviews, stakeholders and users were asked about their experience of using the Compendium and views on future data requirements.</p>

            <p>In response to users' comments a number of initial changes have been made:</p>

            <p><strong>• Improved keywords</strong></p>

            <p>The content of the current keyword database has been extensively reviewed. The aim was to improve the search function by increasing the number of keywords tagged. This should improve indicator access and reduce navigation time.</p>

            <p><strong>• Indicator List</strong></p>

            <p>To aid users in finding indicators there is a full indicator list, which can be downloaded, on the Indicator Portal homepage and on the Compendium homepage. This covers all indicators and not just those on the Compendium.</p>

            <p>From this list, users can filter on:-</p>

            <ul>
             <li>Indicator Portal code</li>
             <li>Indicator group (e.g. Compendium)</li>
             <li>Level 1 (e.g. Hospital care)</li>
             <li>Level 2 (e.g. Admissions)</li>
             <li>Indicator name</li>
             <li>Release date</li>
             <li>Next update expected</li>
            </ul>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This indicator list has also been added to the section called 'Site Updates' on the Indicator Portal homepage, under the heading 'Indicator Portal news' which provides the release history of indicators- date, title and description.&nbsp;<a href="https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/webview/velocity?mode=documentation&amp;submode=catalog&amp;catalog=https%3A%2F%2F192.168.228.51%3A443%2Fobj%2FfCatalog%2FCatalog9" target="_blank">Site Updates</a></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Extra Guidance</strong></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Extra guidance for users on how to filter the indicator list and search is provided through the screenshot guide on the main page of the Indicator Portal.</p>

            <p><a href="https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/download/Indicator_Portal_userguide.pdf" target="_blank">http://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/download/Indicator_Portal_userguide.pdf</a></p>

            <p>User feedback will be used to prioritise other developments over the next 12 months and we continue to seek such feedback on the recent changes to the Indicator Portal.</p>

            <p>Users are also advised to utilise the following sections:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>Additional reading</li>
             <li>Statistical methods and disclosure control</li>
             <li>Terms and conditions</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Future Developments</strong>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>We are in the process of updating the NHS Digital website in line with our new responsibilities under the proposed Health Act which will lead to improved access and functionality for the user. We will keep users informed about how these changes will affect the Compendium and the Indicator Portal as developments occur.</p>

            <p>The NHS Outcomes Framework provides national level accountability for the outcomes the NHS delivers; it drives transparency, quality improvement and outcome measurement throughout the NHS.</p>

            <p>It also sets out the national outcome goals that the Secretary of State uses to monitor the progress of NHS England. It does not set out how these outcomes should be delivered, it is for NHS England to determine how best to deliver improvements by working with Clinical Commissioning Groups to make use of the tools at their disposal.</p>

            <p>The NHS Outcomes Framework uses the ONS mid-year population estimates for England as its subject population, and where standardisation is required the European Standard Population is generally used. All indicators are reported at England level, and are broken down, where possible, by a combination of Age, Lower tier local authority, Upper tier local authority, Region, Religion, Ethnicity, Deprivation decile, Sexual orientation, Gender and Condition.</p>

            <p>The CCG Outcomes Indicator Set uses the registered patient population of England as its subject population, and where standardisation is required, the Office for National Statistics mid-year population estimates for England. All indicators are reported at CCG and National level, where 'National' represents the sum total of patients registered with a GP in England.</p>

            <p><strong>Framework structure</strong></p>

            <p>The framework is structured around five high level outcome domains.</p>

            <ul>
             <li><strong>Domain 1 - Preventing people from dying prematurely</strong><br />
             This domain captures how successful the NHS is in reducing the number of avoidable deaths.</li>
             <li><strong>Domain 2 - Enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions</strong><br />
             This domain captures how successfully the NHS is supporting people with long-term conditions to live as normal a life as possible.</li>
             <li><strong>Domain 3 - Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury</strong><br />
             This domain captures how people recover from ill health or injury and wherever possible how it can be prevented.</li>
             <li><strong>Domain 4 - Ensuring that people have a positive experience of care</strong><br />
             This domain looks at the importance of providing a positive experience of care for patients, service users and carers.</li>
             <li><strong>Domain 5 - Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm</strong><br />
             This domain explores patient safety and its importance in terms of quality of care to deliver better health outcomes.</li>

            <p>The Patient Online services indicator set was commissioned by NHS England to monitor progress against a government ambition for all patients who wish it to have online access to services in general practices by the end of March 2015.</p>

            <p>This information was made available via the PHF10 return that collected information on a quarterly basis from system suppliers on the availability at GP practice level of online appointment booking, ordering of repeat prescriptions and access to medical records, test results, GP letters and summary information (allergies, adverse reactions and medications). This data was collected via the NHS Digital Data Depot secure file transfer system.</p>

            <p>During the 2014/15 financial year (Q2 to Q4) the introduction of data requirements for the NHS Digital's GP System of Choice (GPSoC) team was combined with the PHF10 return and piloted to run monthly reporting in an attempt to make this ‘online availability data’ more frequently accessible and relevant.</p>

            <p>Following the successful pilot of the monthly reporting, GPSoC and NHS England agreed to develop the metrics for this indicator set. As a result, from April 2015 the Patient Online Management Information (POMI) indicator set was introduced, replacing the old PHF10 return. The new POMI return continues to collect information on the availability to patients of electronic access to their test results, GP letters, prescriptions and online appointment booking facilities at the GP Practice level.</p>

            <p>The subset and full medical records viewing services are being redefined to align with the requirements in the 2015/16 GMS/PMS regulations and the two previous indicators have been decommissioned from April 2015. This review will also consider other elements within the indicator set and how these align with the redefined indicators.</p>

            <p>The new indicator to provide information on the availability to patients to access their detailed coded record (DCR) was introduced from February 2016, and the previous indicators for test results and letters decommissioned from April 2016. Work is ongoing between the NHS Digital and NHS England to review existing and, where required, develop further indicators for this data set.</p>

            <p>From April 2017 the Patient Online Management Information data will no longer be published via the Indicator Portal. The data will be made available via the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.nhs.uk/GP-Data-Hub" target="_blank">NHS Digital GP Data Hub</a>.</p>

            <p>The data will continue to be refreshed on a monthly basis, and will be presented in an interactive dashboard in addition to an accessible .csv file, which can be accessed at&nbsp;<a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/pomipublications" target="_blank">http://content.digital.nhs.uk/pomipublications</a>. The time lag between the end of a reporting month and release of the data will be decreased to less than a month (e.g. data for the month of June will be made available before the end of July).</p>

            <p>An overview of the available indicators for both the PHF10 and the POMI returns can be viewed below.</p>

            <p>This information was made available via the PHF10 return that collected information on a quarterly basis from system suppliers on the availability at GP practice level of online appointment booking, ordering of repeat prescriptions and access to medical records, test results, GP letters and summary information (allergies, adverse reactions and medications). This data was collected via the NHS Digital Data Depot secure file transfer system.</p>

            <p>During the 2014/15 financial year (Q2 to Q4) the introduction of data requirements for the NHS Digital's GP System of Choice (GPSoC) team was combined with the PHF10 return and piloted to run monthly reporting in an attempt to make this ‘online availability data’ more frequently accessible and relevant.</p>

            <p>Following the successful pilot of the monthly reporting, GPSoC and NHS England agreed to develop the metrics for this indicator set. As a result, from April 2015 the Patient Online Management Information (POMI) indicator set was introduced, replacing the old PHF10 return. The new POMI return continues to collect information on the availability to patients of electronic access to their test results, GP letters, prescriptions and online appointment booking facilities at the GP Practice level.</p>

            <p>The subset and full medical records viewing services are being redefined to align with the requirements in the 2015/16 GMS/PMS regulations and the two previous indicators have been decommissioned from April 2015. This review will also consider other elements within the indicator set and how these align with the redefined indicators.</p>

            <p>The new indicator to provide information on the availability to patients to access their detailed coded record (DCR) was introduced from February 2016, and the previous indicators for test results and letters decommissioned from April 2016. Work is ongoing between the NHS Digital and NHS England to review existing and, where required, develop further indicators for this data set.</p>

            <p>From April 2017 the Patient Online Management Information data will no longer be published via the Indicator Portal. The data will be made available via the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.nhs.uk/GP-Data-Hub" target="_blank">NHS Digital GP Data Hub</a>.</p>

            <p>The data will continue to be refreshed on a monthly basis, and will be presented in an interactive dashboard in addition to an accessible .csv file, which can be accessed at&nbsp;<a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/pomipublications" target="_blank">http://content.digital.nhs.uk/pomipublications</a>. The time lag between the end of a reporting month and release of the data will be decreased to less than a month (e.g. data for the month of June will be made available before the end of July).</p>

            <p>An overview of the available indicators for both the PHF10 and the POMI returns can be viewed below.</p>

            <p>The Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework measures how well care and support services achieve the outcomes that matter most to people. The ASCOF is used both locally and nationally to set priorities for care and support, measure progress and strengthen transparency and accountability.</p>

            <p>The measures are split across four domains:</p>

            <ol>
             <li>Enhancing quality of life for people with care and support needs</li>
             <li>Delaying and reducing the need for care and support</li>
             <li>Ensuring that people have a positive experience of care and support</li>
             <li>Safeguarding adults whose circumstances make them vulnerable and protecting from avoidable harm</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This section provides data on the ASCOF outcomes for the 2016-17 reporting year. Data are provided at council, regional and national level for each outcome.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Data for the measures are sourced from:&nbsp;</p>

            <ul>
             <li>Personal Social Services Adult Social Care Survey (ASCS)</li>
             <li>Personal Social Services Survey of Adult Carers in England (SACE)</li>
             <li>Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)</li>
             <li>Delayed Transfers of Care (DToC)</li>
             <li>Office for National Statistics (ONS) 2016 mid-year population estimates</li>
             <li>Short and Long-term (SALT) return</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The ASCOF Handbook of Definitions provides full methodologies, rationales and worked examples for each outcome. Users who are unfamiliar with these indicators would benefit from reading this document before making any conclusions on the outcomes. It is available via the following link:<br />

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The 2016-17 ASCOF written report and associated annexes (including disaggregated data in both Excel and .csv formats, relevant tables and charts, monthly data for measures based on data from HES and the Mental Health Services Dataset, and a time-series of aggregated measures) were published on 25 October 2017, and are available on the publication webpage at:<br />

            <p>This section provides data on the ASCOF outcomes for the 2016-17 reporting year. Data are provided at council, regional and national level for each outcome.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Data for the measures are sourced from:&nbsp;</p>

            <ul>
             <li>Personal Social Services Adult Social Care Survey (ASCS)</li>
             <li>Personal Social Services Survey of Adult Carers in England (SACE)</li>
             <li>Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)</li>
             <li>Delayed Transfers of Care (DToC)</li>
             <li>Office for National Statistics (ONS) 2016 mid-year population estimates</li>
             <li>Short and Long-term (SALT) return</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The ASCOF Handbook of Definitions provides full methodologies, rationales and worked examples for each outcome. Users who are unfamiliar with these indicators would benefit from reading this document before making any conclusions on the outcomes. It is available via the following link:<br />
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-outcomes-framework-handbook-of-definitions" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-outcomes-framework-handbook-of-definitions</a></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The 2016-17 ASCOF written report and associated annexes (including disaggregated data in both Excel and .csv formats, relevant tables and charts, monthly data for measures based on data from HES and the Mental Health Services Dataset, and a time-series of aggregated measures) were published on 25 October 2017, and are available on the publication webpage at:<br />
            <a href="http://www.content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB30122" target="_blank">http://www.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB30122</a></p>

            <p>The ASCOF measures 1F and 1H which are based on the Mental Health data set have been suspended in 2016-17 due to the quality and completeness of the data and so are not included in the Indicator Portal. The 1F and 1H outcomes have also not been included in the 2016-17 report, csv, disaggregated annex and time series annex file. The CASSR 1F and 1H scores have been made available in a separate annex file to enable CASSRs to see what their 2016-17 scores would have been, this is available on the publication page at:<br />
